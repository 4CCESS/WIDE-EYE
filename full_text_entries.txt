<p>(Nairobi) – South Sudan’s use of improvised air-dropped incendiary weapons has killed and horrifically burned dozens of people, including children, and destroyed civilian infrastructure in Upper Nile state, Human Rights Watch said today. The government’s use of these weapons in populated areas may amount to war crimes.</p><p>Interviewees described the use of improvised incendiary weapons in at least four attacks in Nasir, Longechuk, and Ulang counties, Upper Nile state, which killed at least 58 people and burned others severely. The United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), which has a&nbsp;robust mandate to protect civilians, should establish temporary operating bases in high risk areas, and proactively respond to the deteriorating situation. UN Security Council members should urge South Sudan to cease its unlawful attacks and call for the urgent deployment of peacekeeping forces to the affected areas.</p><p>“These weapons have killed dozens of people, including children, and left survivors with severe burn injuries causing long-term harm,” said&nbsp;Nyagoah Tut Pur, South Sudan researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The government should immediately stop using indiscriminate incendiary weapons on communities, facilitate safe aid access, and the UN should urgently deploy peacekeepers to the affected areas.”</p><p>The government’s&nbsp;aerial bombardments intensified from March 16, 2025, after a March 4 attack on a&nbsp;government military base and&nbsp;Nasir town by armed Nuer youth known as the “White Army” and a March 7&nbsp;attack by armed men on a UN helicopter that killed a UN crew member and over two dozen South Sudanese soldiers.</p>

<p>On March 17, South Sudan’s information minister said its air force had bombed “so called White Army areas” and falsely implied that civilians who failed to leave the areas&nbsp;could lawfully be targeted. He revealed that Uganda was&nbsp;providing technical support to the South Sudan People’s Defence Forces (SSPDF), which Uganda has&nbsp;acknowledged.</p><p>A Ugandan forces’ spokesperson told Human Rights Watch that their support did not include aerial or ground attacks but could, if requested and they deemed it necessary. The Ugandan forces previously&nbsp;refuted allegations that it had targeted civilians and civilian objects and or used “chemical weapons and barrel bombs.”&nbsp;</p><p>Incendiary weapons&nbsp;inflict excruciating burns and other physical injuries, which can lead to&nbsp;psychological harm and lifelong scarring and disability, which can result in social and economic exclusion. They also&nbsp;cause fires that can indiscriminately destroy civilian objects. Use of these weapons in populated areas violates international humanitarian law, and if done with criminal intent, constitutes a war crime.&nbsp;</p><p>Protocol III to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons explicitly prohibits using air-dropped weapons designed to set fires and burn people in “concentrations of civilians.” While South Sudan is not party to this protocol, its use of these weapons highlights the need to strengthen the international law that governs them.&nbsp;</p><p>Eight people interviewed, including witnesses, local responders, and two government officials, described the March 16 attack on Mathiang, in Longechuk county.&nbsp;</p><p>Witnesses described “barrels”—improvised incendiary weapons—being dropped from what appeared to be a multi-engine aircraft. A 39-year-old woman said: “It came swooping down, I thought it was going to fall on our compound…. Then we saw it drop barrels. As they dropped, [they caught fire].”&nbsp;</p><p>Another woman, 40, woke up feeling “the earth shaking…,” and ran outside … “only to see the village on fire.” She later saw the charred bodies of her neighbors, Khor Ruach Kerjiok, his wife, and their two children under age 10. Another resident said that the burned bodies of two older women aged 60 and above, Nyedier Kuach and Nyeget Kier, were found at home.</p><p>A senior health official said that at least 21 people were killed, 3 of whom died while being transported to Ethiopia for treatment. Health workers responding with very limited resources said the victims had extensive burn injuries. One said the burns continued to spread on the patients’ bodies, indicating that a substance that causes burns was used in the attack.</p><p>Accounts from witnesses describing what they saw and could smell when the improvised incendiary weapons were dropped, indicate that several types of flammable substances are being used as incendiary agents.&nbsp;</p><p>One responder explained how “[t]he area where the [flammable substance] landed was burning for some days, making crackling sounds.” Rain eventually extinguished the fires, “But it still smells … not like gasoline or kerosene,” he said.</p><p>Several residential compounds were burned, along with, a responder said, part of the market and two water pumps.&nbsp;</p><p>A video posted on social media on March 17 shows a fissure in the ground with visible active fire inside. The video reveals a large, burned area, including several tukuls (homes). Satellite imagery shows a burn scar appeared between March 16 to 17, along with burned tukuls 100 meters northeast of the market.</p>

<p>Two witnesses said at least three women suffered miscarriages or stillbirths following the bombing.&nbsp;</p><p>Air-dropped improvised incendiary weapons were also used in Nasir town on March 16 and 19.

<p>Interviewees and photographs suggest that an incendiary weapon was also dropped in Kuich in Ulang county on March 21. Three witnesses describe seeing what appeared to be a propeller-driven aircraft drop incendiary substances in barrels.&nbsp;</p><p>“[The aircraft] dropped something that was on fire and there was a loud explosion [when it hit the ground] and immediately the surrounding caught fire,” one person said. Everyone started running in different directions.” When he returned to the site, he learned that “people [had been] killed on the spot and many people were seriously injured.”</p><p>Four witnesses said the attack killed 15 people, including 3 children, and seriously burned 17 others. A responder in Ulang town described victims, most with burn injuries, “their black skin is coming out. One man who died at the hospital was burned even his teeth. I also saw an older woman in her 70s, she had big blisters.” As of March 30, seven remained in critical condition.&nbsp;</p><p>Civilian structures burned included a nutrition center and a healthcare clinic. A guard there, Duop Bichiok Diew, in his 50s, died from burn injuries. Shelters and a market were also destroyed.&nbsp;</p><p>Photographs posted on social media on March 24, show several structures reduced to ashes near Sobat River in Kuich. Next to the nutrition center, visible impact sites were still burning. Satellite imagery confirmed that at least a dozen structures burned between March 21 and 22.</p>

<p>Government attacks on populated areas in the three counties, notably with helicopter gunfire and munitions continue, putting civilians at further risk and worsening the humanitarian situation, which already included a cholera outbreak.&nbsp;</p><p>Tens of thousands of people have fled, including into Ethiopia. Humanitarian access remains heavily constrained, as aid organizations&nbsp;face violence as well as&nbsp;bureaucratic restrictions.</p><p>South Sudan remains under a&nbsp;UN arms embargo prohibiting external military support to the country’s warring parties. Ugandan forces’&nbsp;participation in the operations violates the embargo. The Security Council should call out Uganda’s violations and ensure renewal of the embargo to protect civilians from unlawful violence, Human Rights Watch said. The council should press South Sudan to ensure that the UN mission can safely operate and approve any requests for additional UN troops.</p><p>“As the government of South Sudan continues to show utter disregard for civilians, it is now dropping flaming barrels of fire from the air,” Pur said. “The international community should press the government to end these unlawful attacks and ensure concrete steps to protect civilian lives.”</p>

Title    : Taiwan’s OAC steps up marine conservation
Published: 2025/04/11
Summary  :
<div class="article-content-part">The Ocean Affairs Council is implementing a research sponsorship program for the second year to foster technological innovation and applications to ensure sustainable marine conservation.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The OAC said it will offer NT$75 million (US$2.28 million) in research grants to 30 selected projects on topics spanning maritime protection and security, ocean pollution prevention, sustainable marine development and smart ocean, as well as surface and underwater vehicle technology development, which are all important subjects of global marine research.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
According to the agency, the country&rsquo;s abundant territorial waters and marine resources render it important for Taiwan to enhance marine technological prowess. This will ensure that local businesses are both globally competitive and meet environmental challenges such as climate change, it said.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In comparison to the NT$14 million spent last year, the increased amount underscores the importance the government attaches to marine technology development, the OAC said. The grants aim to facilitate research and development of marine technology and cultivate personnel, so as to lay an even stronger sustainable marine development foundation, the agency added.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In addition to the research sponsorship, the OAC launched the Marine Pollution Control Fund committee April 9 and Minister Kuan Bi-ling convened the first meeting the same day. The 17-member committee comprises academics and experts with a wide range of expertise and marks a major milestone in government policymaking, it said.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
OAC statistics show that the fund has accumulated NT$210 million as of March this year. With an annual reserve of NT$50 million allocated since 2024, the goal is for the fund to reach NT$500 million in total to ensure the government has enough resources to respond to major marine pollution incidents, the agency added.

Large numbers of rank-and-file militants expressed their support for peace during unprecedented joint celebrations alongside Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) during a nationwide ceasefire for Eid al-Fitr on June 15 - 17. The ceasefire’s events exposed rifts amongst Taliban leadership concerning reconciliation. The U.S. and the Government of Afghanistan could exploit these apparent rifts in order to advance their strategic goal of a negotiated settlement with the Taliban. The new momentum towards peace could nonetheless generate additional pressure for the withdrawal of the U.S. from Afghanistan amidst the scheduled 2018 Afghan Parliamentary Elections.<strong> </strong>ISIS - Wilayat Khorasan could also exploit these rifts in to bolster its recruitment of hardline Taliban militants and expand its operations in Afghanistan.</span></p>

Title    : Connecticut DMV Never Set Up System to Enforce a Century-Old Towing Law
Published: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 05:00:00 -0400
Summary  :
<p class="byline">
                by <a class="name" href="https://ctmirror.org/author/daltimari/">Dave Altimari</a> and <a class="name" href="https://ctmirror.org/author/gmonk/">Ginny Monk</a>, <a href="https://ctmirror.org/">The Connecticut Mirror</a>                </p>
                                             

        
                        <p>This article was produced for ProPublica’s Local Reporting Network in partnership with <a href="https://ctmirror.org/">The Connecticut Mirror</a>. <a href="https://www.propublica.org/newsletters/dispatches">Sign up for Dispatches</a> to get stories like this one as soon as they are published.</p>

        

    
      
  



                    
<p>This year, the head of Connecticut’s Department of Motor Vehicles made a startling public admission, telling lawmakers that the agency, which regulates the towing industry, has never enforced a century-old law meant to protect drivers whose cars are towed.</p>

<p>Under that law, if vehicle owners don’t reclaim their towed cars or can’t afford the fees, towing companies can sell them, but they are required to hold onto the proceeds for a year so the vehicle owner can claim the money. Tow companies are entitled to subtract their fees. But, even if the owner still doesn’t come forward, the companies aren’t supposed to pocket the profits and must turn over any remaining money to the state.</p>

<p>DMV Commissioner Tony Guerrera told lawmakers the agency had never set up a process to accept deposits and wasn’t tracking whether any money had come in.</p>

<p>In fact, the DMV commissioner said he wasn’t aware of that part of the statute until The Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica brought it to his attention last fall as part of an <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/connecticut-dmv-tow-companies-car-sales">investigation into how Connecticut’s laws favor towing companies</a> at the expense of drivers. After the story’s publication, the state treasurer’s office audited its deposits and determined that no tow truck company or the DMV had ever turned over money from sales in the history of the law.</p>

<p>In a statement, Guerrera said, “This law has been in effect since the 1930’s, yet unfortunately, there has never been a system in place to effectively monitor its implementation.”</p>

<p>This failure has hurt both vehicle owners and the state itself: Owners don’t have the opportunity to get money back that the law says should be theirs, and the state is missing out on both the potential payments and any interest or investment income that would accrue from the deposits.</p>

<p>The unenforced law is another example of how the DMV has failed to oversee the towing industry, which sells thousands of cars following tows each year. In an extreme case, reported by the news organizations last month, a DMV employee was found to be part of a scheme to <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/connecticut-dmv-employee-sells-towed-cars">undervalue cars and sell them for thousands in profit</a>, according to an internal DMV investigation. The employee denied he did anything wrong and still works at the DMV. </p>

<p>In another, criminal court records show, a Norwalk towing company owner was caught driving a Mercedes-Benz he had towed, racking up nearly 6,000 miles in 22 months. The tower was charged with larceny and participated in a diversion program, after which his record was expunged. CT Mirror and ProPublica have spoken to dozens of people who had their cars towed and never saw them again. Many said they weren’t notified that their cars would be sold.</p>

<p>Legislators are now aiming to create a system to make sure car owners — or eventually the state — get that money. A <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2025/TOB/H/PDF/2025HB-07162-R00-HB.PDF">wide-ranging bill</a> to <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/connecticut-lawmakers-seek-overhaul-of-towing-laws">overhaul the entire towing statute</a> would require towing companies to submit documentation to the DMV of the sale price, any towing and storage fees they incurred and information on the vehicle and its owner within 15 days of a sale.</p>

<p>The bill would also reform the process of “escheating,” or remitting money to the state. After reviewing the sale document, the DMV would require the tower to send a certified letter notifying the owner or lienholder of the sales proceeds. Instead of the general fund, leftover money would be sent to the state’s unclaimed property fund and appear on a publicly posted list.</p>

<p>Guerrera said the DMV recently added more staff charged with overseeing the sales system and added a section to its website this year to ensure tow companies are aware of the requirement to turn money over to the state.</p>

<p>During an interview late last year, Guerrera said that implementing the process wasn’t the DMV’s responsibility and that doing so was up to the state treasurer’s office. But the treasurer pushed back on that in a statement, saying it fell under DMV rules. After the initial CT Mirror and ProPublica story was published, Guerrera took more ownership.</p>

<p>“I am glad this has been brought to my attention and I am more than prepared to address this issue, ensuring that it is now being handled properly and in accordance with its intended purposes,” he said in a statement.</p>

<p>The Transportation Committee approved the bill on March 19, sending it to the House. Some lawmakers opposed it, arguing the bill was intended to target a “few bad apples” but adds unnecessary regulations on all towing companies.</p>

<p>House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said he expects lots of debate as the bill winds its way through the legislature, but he said the escheating process needs to be addressed.</p>

<p>“There’s got to be some accountability and transparency on that for sure,” Ritter said. “This is people’s property.”</p>

<p>Timothy Vibert, president of Towing and Recovery Professionals of Connecticut, said a past association president asked DMV officials about how to return funds to the state but received no answers.</p>

<p>He said tow companies rarely make back their towing and storage fees when they sell cars and questioned why any tower would ever give the state money.</p>

<p>“There might have been a little bit of a windfall with one car or another, but there’s been a whole lot of losers, so why does the state get a chance to take it?” asked Vibert, who owns Farmington Motor Sports. </p>

<p>He added that many towers would rather return the cars.</p>

<p>“What the towers are doing is keeping those cars and then just getting rid of them for $500 or $600,” Vibert added. “So we’re keeping the cars for, I’m going to guess 45 days, maybe sometimes 50, depending on the paperwork, and then we’re just disposing of them because they’re not worth anything.”</p>

<p>House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, said he thinks there usually isn’t money left over after fees. “I think, frankly, what usually happens is the tow companies wait for the towing and storage fees to exceed the value, so it never ends up going to the state or back to the individual,” he said.</p>

<p>Kristianne Hall experienced the fees piling up firsthand while she was bartending in downtown New Haven. The job posed a delicate balance. She had to work her shift and offer sufficient service to get good tips. But she also had to keep the parking meter fed. There were a few times Hall couldn’t get to the meter, and parking tickets stacked up.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            Kristianne Hall said she should have received thousands of dollars after her car was towed and sold, but she never got anything.

<p>In 2015, her car got booted and then towed when she couldn’t afford to pay the $500 to get the device taken off. By the time she had that money saved, she said, the towing company quoted her $2,000 to get the vehicle back from its lot.</p>

<p>Hall couldn’t afford that and never saw the car again. She estimated the 2008 Chevrolet Aveo was worth about $5,000, which is supported by a Kelley Blue Book report, thousands more than what the towing company told her she’d need to pay to get it back.</p>

<p>“Why was I not entitled to the rest of that money if I own that car outright?” she asked.</p>

<p>After the tow, Hall struggled to get to and from work. She had to take an Uber home because the city bus stopped running before her shifts ended. She quickly ran low on money and had to turn to her roommates to help her pay bills before she eventually moved in with her grandparents in Florida.</p>

<p>“I felt like a failure because I couldn’t hack it,” Hall said. “It was a really, really hard and almost traumatic situation.”</p>

Title    : Google sued for £5bn in UK over allegations of shutting out rivals

<p>Class action argues US tech firm charged more for advertising on its preinstalled apps than it could in fair market</p><p>Google is being sued in the UK for up to £5bn in damages over allegations it shut out rivals in the internet search market and abused this dominance to overcharge businesses for advertisements.<br /><br />
 A class action filed at the competition appeal tribunal on Wednesday argues that the US company has taken actions that enable it to charge higher prices for the promotions that appear in search queries than it otherwise could in a fair market.<br /><br />
 It is alleged that Google, which is owned by Alphabet, contracted phone makers to pre-install the Google search app and Chrome browser on Android devices and paid Apple to make it the default search engine on iPhones, with the intention of shutting out competition.<br /><br />
 The claim is filed by a competition law expert, Or Brook, on behalf of thousands of businesses and alleges Google ensured its search engine had better functionality and more features for Google’s own advertising offering than that of its competitors.</p><p>A Google spokesperson said: “This is yet another speculative and opportunistic case and we will argue against it vigorously. Consumers and advertisers use Google because it is helpful, not because there are no alternatives.”</p> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/apr/16/google-sued-for-5bn-in-uk-over-allegations-of-shutting-out-rivals">Continue reading...</a>

                                                          <p>Heavy rainfall has been affecting Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, since 4 April, causing flooding and landslides that have resulted in casualties and damage. According to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), as of 7 April, 33 people have died and 46 were injured due to the overflow of the Ndjili River, affecting 13 out of 24 municipalities in Kinshasa city area. Media reports further indicate that several roads and houses have been destroyed or damaged, power outages have been recorded, and the water supply has been cut off. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4144934">ECHO, 8 Apr 2025</a>)</p>
<p>Following floods, the Ndjili river overflow, and landslides that occurred across 13 municipalities (out of 24) of the Kinshasa capital city (western Democratic Republic of the Congo) over the period from 4 to 11 April, the number of casualties has increased, and widespread damage was reported. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) reports, as of 13 April, 165 fatalities, 28 injured persons, more than 7,000 displaced people (a number of these across four relief sites) and a total of over 60,000 affected people across the Kinshasa capital city area. In addition, the IFRC also reports several destroyed and damaged houses. The UNOSAT was activated on 11 April and the International Charter was activated on 10 April to provide the damage assessment. Over the next 96 hours, more rainfall is still forecast over the already affected Kinshasa area. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4146232">ECHO, 14 Apr 2025</a>)</p>
<p>Severe flooding triggered by torrential rains in recent weeks has displaced almost 10,000 people in Tanganyika Province, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This unfolding emergency reflects the double crisis facing the DRC, where extreme weather shocks such as flooding compound the suffering caused by ongoing conflict and mass displacement. The Rugumba River burst its banks, inundating large areas of Kalemie and Nyunzu territories. Homes, schools and agricultural land have been destroyed, leaving thousands without shelter or livelihoods. Stagnant and contaminated floodwaters are raising concerns over the risk of disease outbreaks, with reported cholera cases in the province already six times higher than during the same period last year. The flooding has hit a community already under severe strain. Since January, Tanganyika has received around 50,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) fleeing violence in South Kivu. Many had been sheltering in local homes, churches, and schools—now damaged or destroyed. The floods also wiped out key crops like cassava, maize, and peanuts, worsening an already serious food insecurity situation in the country.

                                                          <p>A strong earthquake of 7.7 M at a depth of 10 km occurred on 28 March at 06.20 UTC (12.50 local time) in Sagaing Region, central Myanmar. The epicentre was located about 16 km north-north-west of Sagaing city, and 19 km north-west of Mandalay city. An aftershock of 6.4 M at a depth of 10 km occurred in the same area at 06.32 UTC. Sagaing is home to 1.3 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) – a third of all IDPs in Myanmar. USGS PAGER estimates that up to 7,000 people were exposed to violent shaking, up to 2,866,000 people to severe shaking, and up to 10,190,000 exposed to strong and very strong shaking. According to media reports, several buildings collapsed in Mandalay city, and buckling roads have been observed in Naypyidaw, the capital of Myanmar. The earthquake was felt in Bangkok and Chiang Mai cities in Thailand, where people have been evacuated from buildings, and in Yunnan and Shaanxi provinces in China. Aftershocks are continuing to be felt across the country. Myanmar has the fifth highest number of people in need of humanitarian assistance globally – 20 million, or about a third of the country. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4142703">ECHO, 28 Mar 2025</a>)</p>
<p>As of 29 March 2025, the official death toll stood at over 1,600, with 3,408 people injured and over 200 people missing. According to early modelling by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the final death toll could surpass 10,000 people. Initial estimates indicate that 18.3 million people, 4.04 million households, and USD 77.5 billion in infrastructure are concentrated within the affected area. The earthquake compounds the protracted crisis generated by armed conflict, political instability and disasters (large-scale flooding and heatwaves in 2024, among others). [...] In Sagaing Township, it is reported that over 70% of structures have sustained significant damage. Many residential buildings have either completely collapsed or were severely damaged. Two bridges between the Yangon – Naypyidaw highways were reported as being damaged, risking the disruption of critical transportation routes between Yangon and the most affected regions. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4143028/">IFRC, 30 Mar 2025</a>)</p>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that as of 30 March, there are a total of 2,601 fatalities due to the earthquake, 1,790 in Mandalay city, 402 in the capital Naypyidaw, 314 in Sagaing city, 79 in Southern Shan state, 35 in Bago city, and 3,408 injured people.

UN OCHA and MSF report over 300 people still missing, some 3,900 injured, and more than 13,000 displaced across the country. More than 10,000 buildings collapsed or were severely damaged. The Myanmar military has continued to conduct air strikes against civilians in the aftermath of the earthquake – the military seized power in a coup in 2021 and the country is in active conflict. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4143342/">ECHO, 1 Apr 2025</a>)</p>
<p>As of 3 April, media reports 3,085 fatalities, 4,715 injured people, still 341 missing people. The AHA Centre reports that 21,783 houses have been affected, of which 15,114 have been destroyed, and that the state of emergency remains in effect for Mandalay, Sagaing Magway, Shan State, Naypyidaw, and Bago areas. Media also reports that the military government declared a temporary ceasefire to facilitate humanitarian support for the affected people. Several opposition forces had already said they would stop hostilities in the wake of the earthquake. According to the Asian Disaster Reduction Center (ADRC) report, in Thailand 20 fatalities, 35 injured people and 771 affected houses have been recorded. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4143801/">ECHO, 3 Apr 2025</a>)</p>
<p>The AHA Centre reports that as of 6 April, there are approximately 3,500 fatalities, 210 missing persons, more than 5,000 injured people, and around 69,100 displaced people, with the worst affected area being the Mandalay region. UN OCHA also reports over 17 million affected people across the country. [...] Despite a ceasefire announced on 2 April, over 30 attacks have been reported as taking place since then, including in earthquake-affected areas. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4144520/">ECHO, 7 Apr 2025</a>)</p>
<p>As of 8 April, media reports indicate over 3,600 deaths, 160 missing persons, 5,017 injured, and approximately 69,100 displaced individuals. The Mandalay region has been the hardest hit, while UN OCHA estimates that over 17.2 million people have been affected across the impacted areas.

(<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4144931/">ECHO, 8 Apr 2025</a>)</p>
<p>More than 9 million people (including 2.7 million children) are estimated to be the worst affected across 58 townships in Bago East, Kayin, Magway, Mandalay, Nay Pyi Taw, Shan South, and Sagaing. Latest reports indicate continued infrastructure damage which include 193 healthcare facilities, and 2,311 schools.  There is a growing concern among communities about the risk of infectious diseases, due to improperly managed corpses and the lack of access to safe water and sanitation facilities. A cluster of mild to moderate acute watery diarrhoea (AWD) cases has been reported in Sagaing Township and urban areas of Mandalay. WASH cluster partners have so far identified over 42,000 damaged latrines and report significant damage to urban water systems and rural aquifers. Extreme heat - reaching 44°C (111°F) – and off-season rains are further exacerbating the situation for responders and survivors, many of whom are still sleeping outdoors.

<p>The death toll continues to rise in Myanmar and Thailand following the strong 7.7 magnitude earthquake that struck near Mandalay city on 28 March. In the past seven days, at least five additional earthquakes up to 4.8 magnitude have been recorded between Mandalay and the capital, Naypyidaw. In Myanmar, the AHA Centre reports 3,603 fatalities, 141 people still missing, and 4,817 injured. Nearly 200,000 people are currently displaced, with 40,896 of them staying in 127 temporary shelters.

                                                          <p>On 13 March, a major oil pipeline ruptured inland Ecuador, contaminating several rivers and outpouring into coastal areas. More than 300,000 people are affected, primarily due to the suspension of potable water in the area. The lack of safe access to water increases the risk of disease and heightens vulnerabilities and needs in affected communities that are already highly marginalized. On 20 March, the Government officially requested support from the United Nations, specifically noting the Joint Environment Unit (JEU) and UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC). The situation is further exacerbated by ongoing security challenges in Esmeraldas, one of the provinces most affected by the national security crisis, while heavy rains continue to hinder response efforts. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4140985/">OCHA, 20 Mar 2025</a>)</p>
<p>The rupture of the SOTE Pipeline on 13 March 2025 in the province of Esmeraldas caused, according to official sources, a spill of more than 25,000 barrels of oil, extending 86 km and affecting 11 parishes. Some 500,000 people have been affected by limited access to safe potable water, with serious health consequences, including respiratory conditions and exposure to toxic gases. The affected areas of the crisis face high violence, with the presence of criminal groups, raising concerns about the security situation. Provincial and cantonal EOCs have been activated, but gaps persist in the water, health, food security, and livelihood sectors. A state of emergency due to a natural disaster was declared throughout the province of Esmeraldas on 26 March. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4142809">OCHA, 27 Mar 2025</a>)</p>

Major cities such as Al Anbar, Erbil, Al Qadisiyyah, Diyala, and Thi Qar were affected, flooding streets, causing road disruptions, and the suspension of basic services, most notably sewage, power plants, potable water, and communications. Due to the severity of its impact, most governorates were forced to suspend the official working hours of schools and universities in order to ensure the safety of citizens. In Baghdad, the heavy rainfall, which measured over 72 millimetres in just one hour, far surpassed the city's infrastructure limits, which can handle only between 24 and 38 millimetres per hour. Residential areas and roads were inundated, leading to traffic chaos and property damage. The Kurdistan Region also experienced widespread flooding, with reports of homes and businesses being affected. Authorities have been working to manage the emergency, but the scale of the flooding has overwhelmed local resources. Heavy flooding was also reported in Babil and Karbala governorates, where main roads are submerged, particularly in the cities.

<p>The weather system is forecasted to linger over Nampula province until the evening of 10 March, bringing with it heavy rains – exceeding 250 mm in 24 hours – accompanied by severe thunderstorms that could trigger floods in the provinces of Nampula, Zambezia, Cabo Delgado, and Sofala (WFP ADAM flood forecast). The Hydrological Department issued a flooding alert in the areas along the main river basins of Nampula, and localized flooding has been reported in Nacala and Ilha de Moçambique districts.</p>
<p>Initial reports from partners in the field indicate the impact of the cyclone on houses, public infrastructure including roads, electricity and telecommunication lines. INGD and IOM-DTM teams were pre-deployed in the districts and are on standby for rapid needs assessments in areas that will be accessible.</p>
<p>At least 780,468 people are at very high and high risk across the provinces of the cyclone’s track, among them the 508,167 people in Nampula province and 272,302 people in Zambezia province. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4138630/">OCHA, 10 Mar 2025</a>)</p>
<p>Mozambique’s National Institute for Disaster Management (INGD) reports that as of 19 March, the total number of people affected stood at 390,000 people with 16 deaths.

                                                          <p>On 6 March, the National Meteorological Service, through its Early Warning System, established the Orange Alert Level for storms for the southern region of the Province of Buenos Aires. Given that this represented a dangerous phenomenon for society, life, property and the environment, both the municipal authorities and different community institutions took preventive measures such as the suspension of classes, cancellation of outdoor activities and reinforcements in risk communication.</p>
<p>In the early hours of the morning of 7 March, the Bahía Blanca District, located on the southern coast of the province, experienced intense and prolonged rains, reaching a total of more than 300 mm in a sustained period of six hours. During the morning, the official agency raised the Alert Level to Red, in view of the short-term forecasts that foresaw the continuity of rainfall, with an expected accumulation of an additional 100 mm. The course of the Napostá stream, which crosses the city, did not have enough capacity to guarantee adequate rainfall runoff, which caused an overflow that generated significant impacts in 70% of the area.</p>
<p>In terms of its impact, the flood caused partial and total damage to the infrastructure of homes and businesses, light poles, walls, trees and signs, causing extensive material losses and interruptions in essential services such as medical care, transportation, electricity, gas, fuel, telecommunications and water supply.</p>
<p>The flood affected the vast majority of the community, both in urban and peri-urban areas, with the most affected areas being those in the east and southeast of the district. Many households experienced water inflow that has reached heights of two meters in some regions, including in the urban centre. Although approximately 50% of the affected areas have been drained, the recovery process is expected to take several weeks in some cases. Thus, particularly vulnerable areas such as the towns of General Cerri and Ingeniero White continue to face flooding challenges due to their geographical location, pre-existing drainage problems and high levels of vulnerability. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4140605/">IFRC, 19 Mar 2025</a>)</p>
<p>In northern Argentina, the overflowing Pilcomayo and Bermejo rivers has caused significant floods and flash floods, resulting in significant damage and power outages in Salta province, particularly the Chaco region of Salta. The situation is worsened by intense winds exceeding 100 km/h.</p>
<p>As of 31 March, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies reports that 2,000 people have been affected. Local authorities activated emergency protocols and conducted immediate evacuations in high-risk areas. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4143344/">ECHO, 01 Apr 2025</a>)</p>

The most critical impact was recorded on 1 March and the disaster is still ongoing, with heavy snow and extreme weather conditions continuing to affect Guria, Adjara, Imereti, and Mtskheta-Mtianeti. Many villages remain isolated, thousands of people are still without electricity, and emergency responders are facing serious challenges in reaching those in need.</p>
<p>In Guria, snowdrifts continue to block roads, leaving villages like Chokhatauri, Gogole District, and Ozurgeti cut off from essential supplies. Residents of Buknari, Kvenobani, and Basileti remain stranded, while people in Jumati, Konchati, and Kokati face food shortages and worsening conditions. With ongoing snowfall, there is still no clear timeframe for when access to these areas will be restored.</p>
<p>In Imereti, around 30,000 people are still without electricity, and 149 villages remain inaccessible. Schools remain closed, and relief efforts are slowed down by the extreme weather. In Adjara, conditions have not improved, as Batumi continues to face power outages and mobility restrictions due to icy roads. In Khulo, Shuakhevi, and Keda, nearly 20 villages remain surrounded by snow, and some homes are still buried. Reports indicate a serious lack of food, medical supplies, and heating, while avalanche risks remain high.</p>
<p>The death toll stands at 3 (three), with recent reports confirming that people have died from collapsed roofs, unavailability of essential medicines, and lack of timely medical access. Emergency responders and military personnel are still working to clear roads and evacuate people from the hardest-hit areas, but the ongoing snowfall makes their work extremely difficult.

                                                          <p>In Luanda on January 7th out of 25 suspected cases of cholera, 5 deaths were reported. On January 8th, over 30 suspected cases of cholera were recorded in the same area of Luanda province. The rapid escalation of suspected cases indicates potential for a continued worsening outbreak. Other areas of concern noted by Ministry of Health include the northern provinces that border DRC, where outbreaks of cholera have been reported in the past. Combined with heavy rainfall, poor sanitation and limited access to clean water, the risk of floods and water-borne diseases is exacerbated. INAMET - National Institute of Meteorology and Geophysics - predicts above-average rainfall for the current rainy season. Flood risk for Angola is high during this period of time. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4124188">IFRC, 10 Jan 2025</a>)</p>
<p>By January 11th, 170 suspected cases were recorded with 30 conrmed cases across 3 provinces (Luanda, Bengo, Icolo &amp; Bengo). By
January 17th, 422 cases have been reported with 24 deaths leading to a high case fatality rate (5.7%) (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4127486">IFRC, 21 Jan 2025</a>)</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the outbreak, a cumulative total of 1,081 cases have been reported, 748 in the Province of Luanda, 201 in the Province of Icolo and Bengo, 124 in the Province of Bengo, 3 in the Province of Malanje, 3 in the Province of Huambo and 2 in Province of Huíla, aged between 2 and 86 years, of which 527 (49.0%) male and 554 (51.0%) female. There were 45 deaths, of which 32 in the Province of Luanda (Cacuaco: 24, Mulenvos: 3, Sambizanga: 2 and 1 in Belas, Cazenga, Kilamba Kiaxi); 8 in the Province of Bengo (Panguila: 4, Dande: 3 and Barra do Dande: 1) and 5 in the Province of Icolo and Bengo, in the Municipality of Sequele, aged between 2 and 69 years, of whom 31 (69.0%) were male and 14 (31.0%) were female. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4127971">UNICEF, 27 Jan 2025</a>)</p>
<p>Following a plateau in the last two weeks, cholera cases have dropped for the first time in Angola since the onset of the outbreak. In epidemiological week 8 (17 - 23 February 2025), a total of 807 cases with 33 deaths were reported across the country. Most (96.3%) of the new cases were reported from Luanda (n=437), Bengo (n=256), and Icolo e Bengo (n=84). Cumulatively, 4914 cases with 180 deaths (CFR 3.7%) have been reported from 10 provinces across the country. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4136168">WHO, 27 Feb 2025</a>)</p>
<p>The cholera outbreak in Angola continues to unfold, with an increasing number of cases and widespread geographic expansion. Since our last update in Weekly Bulletin 7 (10–16 February 2025), the outbreak has spread to five additional provinces, namely; Benguela, Bié, Cabinda, Cubango, and Uíge, bringing the total affected provinces to 15.

Title    : Ethiopia: Earthquakes - Jan 2025
Published: Sat, 04 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000
Summary  :
<div class="tag country">Affected country: Ethiopia</div>
                                      <div class="tag glide">Glide: EQ-2025-000001-ETH</div>
                                                          <p>The Fentale volcanic complex in the Main Ethiopian Rift has seen increased seismic activity since October 2024. In late December 2024, earthquake frequency spiked with several magnitude 5 events, accompanied by the opening of steam vents (releasing steam and gases from underground). This surge is believed to be linked to magma movement, though it’s uncertain whether an eruption will occur and from which volcano or vent—in Fentale, Dofen, or a new location. Between 4 and 6 January, over 20 earthquakes have struck the Awash Fentale area, with the strongest, a magnitude 5.8, occurring on January 4 near the Dofen mountains. This tremor caused significant damage to the Kesem Sugar Factory, highlighting the destructive potential of the ongoing seismic activity. Approximately 80,000 people are affected across the two regions—60,000 in Afar and 20,000 in Oromia—and many residents are uncertain about the appropriate actions to take. About 30,000 people have already relocated, and the government is working to evacuate another 50,000 people. There is an urgent need for the provision of food and water trucking to meet the immediate needs of the displaced population. Three relocation sites have been identified in the Awash district: Daido, Asbole Boda, and Medala; four sites in Dulecha district: Garrayto, Hadale Abur, Gudili, and Daido; and eight sites in Oromia: Tututi, Turo, Gidara, Alge, Galcha, Fateledi, Sarawayba and Matahara town. The government is considering reducing the number of sites. No casualties have been reported; however, significant damage has occurred to infrastructure, including homes, health centers, schools and roads. Widening fissures are affecting several roads and there are concerns about the nearby Kesam/Sabure Dam. Although it is designed to withstand earthquakes up to a magnitude of 5.6, it holds a significant volume of water, and any failure could result in catastrophic flooding downstream, potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of people. Scientific assessments are ongoing, but predictions remain uncertain. The cumulative impact of these earthquakes underscores the need for urgent measures to assess and address the vulnerability of local infrastructure. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4123473">OCHA, 6 Jan 2025</a>)</p>
<p>Seismic activity continues across parts of Afar and Oromia, particularly in Awash and Dulecha districts. Between 8 and 10 January, 18 earthquakes, ranging from 4.4 to 5.3 in magnitude, have been recorded, bringing the total number of tremors to about 50 in the past week. The strongest, a magnitude 5.8, occurring at a depth of 10km, on 4 January, near the Dofen mountains. Its effects were felt as far away as the capital city, Addis Ababa. [...] In Afar, local authorities report that 51,456 people have been registered and partially evacuated to two designated sites. In Oromia, authorities note that around 20,325 individuals have moved from the Fentale district to 11 informal IDPs sites, including schools and other facilities. Evacuating pastoralist communities is particularly challenging due to their concerns about abandoning their livestock, which are vital to their livelihoods, as well as the potential disruption of their communal connections. In some cases, heads of households are staying behind to care for their property. Movement continues, and all sites are still receiving IDPs. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4124435">OCHA, 10 Jan 2025</a>)</p>
<p>The intense seismic activity that has been affecting the southern Afar and northern Oromia regions, near the Fentale and the Dofan volcanoes in the Main Ethiopian Rift, continues. About 50 earthquakes of magnitude 4.2 to 5.8 have been recorded between 4 and 10 January 2025; the most recent one, of 5.2 M, was reported on 11 January at 00:19 UTC (03:19 local time) at a depth of 10 km, approximately 160 km north-eastern of Addis Ababa. According to UN OCHA, as of 11 January, at least two people have been injured by the seismic activity, more than 60,000 people have been evacuated, including 51,456 registered and partially evacuated in Afar and 20,325 in Oromia, and emergency shelters have been set up. Significant damage has also been recorded, with 16 schools severely damaged, and 21 partially. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4124659">ECHO, 13 Jan 2025</a>)</p>
<p>An earthquake of 5.5 M at a depth of 10 km occurred in southern Afar region, central Ethiopia on 16 March at 18.53 UTC (21.53 local time). The epicentre was located 4 km south-east of Fentale volcano and 43 km north of Awash city in southern Afar region. An aftershock of 4.3 M hit the same area on 16 March at 22.20 UTC. USGS PAGER estimates that up to 6,000 people were exposed to severe shaking, 26,000 to very strong shaking and 14,000 to strong shaking. Since December 2024, this area between the Fentale and Dofan volcanoes, in southern Afar and northern Oromia regions, has been experiencing intense seismic activity with earthquakes that reached up to 6.0 M. More than 80,000 people have evacuated the affected areas since January and several infrastructures have been severely damaged.

A tsunami warning was issued but has since been lifted. Search and rescue operations are ongoing at the time of reporting. Preliminary reports indicate observed damages to buildings and infrastructure in Port Vila, with six unconfirmed casualties and injuries reported. According to UNOSAT initial exposure analysis, an estimate of 116,000 people could be affected by the worst impacts of the earthquake. Telecommunications remain disrupted and is affecting the timeliness of field reports from remote areas. Access to the airport and water port is severely limited due to road damage. Key immediate needs include healthcare support, shelter, access to clean water, and the restoration of emergency communications.(<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4119043">OCHA, 17 Dec 2024</a>)</p>
<p>As of 18th December, NDMO confirmed 14 fatalities either from collapsed buildings or landslides. The numbers may rise as search and rescue operations intensifies and expands. Over 200 are reported injured while many are still missing. According to UNICEF staff on the ground, most injuries are fractures, cuts and traumas related to falling objects and sharp items. According to NDMO, two major water reservoirs in Port Vila are severely damaged. Assessment of water network is ongoing with affected residents already rationing water. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4119369">UNICEF, 18 Dec 2024</a>)</p>
<p>Approximately 80,000 people have been directly affected by the earthquake, of which 14,104 are children and 769 are persons with disabilities (PWD). The Disaster Evacuation Centre Management Cluster (DEMC) reports that 947 people have been displaced. Infrastructure damage is extensive, with landslides further obstructing road access in Efate and outer islands, including routes to the Seaport. The airport is currently closed to all commercial flights. Physical Access challenges continue to hamper response efforts. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4120223/">OCHA, 19 Dec 2024</a>)</p>
<p>The situation in Vanuatu remains critical following the 7.3 magnitude earthquake that struck on December 17, 2024. VMGD has confirmed that approximately 300 aftershocks, ranging from magnitudes of 2.0 to 5.3, have occurred with shallow depths between December 17 and December 19. The earthquake has resulted in significant devastation, with the death toll rising to 14 (eight males, five females, one unknown) and 265 injuries. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4121629">OCHA, 26 Dec 2024</a>)</p>
<p>Two major water reservoirs in Port Vila sustained severe damage, and ongoing assessments of the water network have led to water rationing for residents. Port Vila International Airport resumed commercial flights on 22 December, following consultations with airport agencies. However, landslides and damaged roads and bridges have hindered access to the airport and seaport. While the airport is operational, the seaport is still closed. The situation is compounded by the ongoing cyclone season, with three tropical cyclones predicted in the region posing more risks to already vulnerable populations. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4121106/">UNICEF, 23 Dec 2024</a>)</p>
<p>State of Emergency (SOE) concluded on December 24, 2024 with the coordination of operations transitioning to the Recovery Operations Centre (ROC) under the Prime Minister's Office. The NDMO, National Cluster Partners and Pacific Humanitarian Team (PHT) members are coordinating ongoing distribution of relief items to meet needs identified under the SOE including shelter, WASH, Protection, Health, Food and other essential supplies.

      <p style="background: white; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: #222222;">While the Trump administration has had rocky relations with many traditional U.S. security partners, Saudi Arabia is faring well.

While specifics have not been agreed, Secretary Wright indicated the U.S. would require Saudi Arabia to conclude a so-called “</span><a href="http://energy.gov/nnsa/123-agreements-peaceful-cooperation"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: black;">123 Agreement</span></a><span lang="EN-US" style="color: #222222;">”, which normally includes nonproliferation commitments by the state receiving U.S. nuclear cooperation. Possible differences on these create uncertainty about the path forward, but the announcement is nonetheless notable.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-US" style="color: #222222;">First, it marks a de-packaging of issues relating to civilian nuclear support (something the Saudis have long requested of the U.S.) from the pursuit of Saudi-Israel normalisation (something the U.S. has long requested of the Saudis). That linkage was never something Riyadh wanted, but the Biden administration insisted on it. Indeed, the Biden team linked normalisation to a number of issues – including Riyadh’s desire for formal U.S. security commitments, enhanced defence arrangements and deeper technological and economic cooperation. For its part, Riyadh linked normalisation to the need for a political horizon for the Palestinians – and began to treat the former as a dead letter amid Israel’s military campaign following Hamas’ 7 October 2023 attacks. Recent Saudi&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8x5570514o"><span lang="EN-US">statements</span></a><span lang="EN-US" style="color: #222222;"> have&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/countering-trump-saudi-arabia-says-no-israel-normalization-without-palestinian-state/"><span lang="EN-US">underscored</span></a><span lang="EN-US" style="color: #222222;"> that point. Yet&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-US">the Trump administration nevertheless is willing to work with the Saudis on the nuclear issue.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="background: white; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: #222222;">Secondly, the impending MOU is a reminder that the Trump team has greater freedom of manoeuvre than its predecessor on Israel and U.S. domestic politics related to it. The Biden administration worried about decoupling normalisation from Riyadh’s requests, and believed that attempting to conclude stand-alone agreements with Saudi Arabia would encounter resistance from Democrats in Congress. The Biden administration saw Saudi-Israel normalisation as the sweetener that could enable broader support. But the Trump team seems less concerned about how either Israel or its U.S. supporters will react. This was also evident when it engaged directly in hostage negotiations with Hamas and launched talks with Iran on its nuclear program. (With Trump’s team engaging with Iran and the president traveling to Saudi Arabia in May on his first foreign visit, it is unsurprising that his administration is preparing for that trip and shoring up Gulf ties.)&nbsp;</span></p><p style="background: white; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span lang="EN-US" style="color: #222222;">Lastly, the announcement raises questions about other pieces of the Biden-era normalisation package, including Riyadh’s requests for U.S. security guarantees.&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-US" style="background: white; color: black;">Here the going is tougher. It could founder on the administration’s f</span><span lang="EN-US" style="color: #222222;">actional divides between traditional primacists and those who want to see a reduced Middle East presence to focus on China. In more expansive form such an agreement would require Senate approval and would encounter resistance, particularly among Democrats. Nonetheless, the Saudis could well approach the Trump administration with requests for U.S. support previously bound up with the normalisation effort, as they aim to take advantage of their warm relationship with Washington.&nbsp;</span></p>

As during his first term in office, Trump has often prosecuted this war with renewed or greater intensity. His administration quickly&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/01/us/politics/counterterrorism-drone-strikes.html" style="text-decoration: none;"><span>repealed</span></a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> the Biden White House’s restrictions on counter-terrorism strikes. As during his previous term, the U.S. military continued bombing al-Qaeda and ISIS affiliates in Somalia, Syria and Iraq under the core counter-terrorism statute – the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Force (2001 AUMF). After redesignating Yemen’s Houthi rebels as a foreign terrorist organisation (FTO) (which he had done in his first term and Biden had undone), Trump also took the U.S. back to war in Yemen, responding to Houthi threats to international shipping in the Red Sea. Relying on the president’s claimed authority as “commander-in-chief” under the Constitution, Trump has reportedly signed off on a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/15/us/politics/us-attack-houthis.html" style="text-decoration: none;"><span>more aggressive air campaign</span></a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> against the Houthis than Biden was willing to approve.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">But while continuing to wage this iteration of the war on terror in the Middle East and Africa, the Trump administration has also repurposed the tools and tropes of counter-terrorism against new targets: drug cartels and migrants. It is also regularly using the rhetoric of counter-terrorism against the president’s domestic political opponents. In so doing, it is claiming authority to wield broad, weakly constrained power at home and abroad. In some respects, the Trump administration is taking more extreme actions than President George W. Bush’s White House did in the initial period following the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/united-states/005-overkill-reforming-legal-basis-us-war-terror" style="text-decoration: none;"><span>11 September 2001 attacks</span></a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> – a period notorious for&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CRPT-113srpt288.pdf" style="text-decoration: none;"><span>detainee abuse</span></a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> and efforts to circumvent the rule of law.

The application of this authority to drug cartels and gangs was unprecedented. But in a sense, it followed the norm-breaking pattern of the first Trump administration, which had so designated Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps – the first time the U.S. had used this authority to designate a state entity. Though an FTO designation does not by itself provide authority for the use of force, it is an escalatory measure, and in some cases, U.S. officials view it as a stepping stone to military action. Just as designating the Revolutionary Guards helped pave the way for the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.justsecurity.org/79700/time-for-the-biden-administration-to-disavow-the-dangerous-soleimani-legal-opinions/" style="text-decoration: none;"><span>January 2020 drone strike</span></a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> that killed that group’s commander, Qassem Soleimani, so classifying cartels as terrorists may serve the same function.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">The rhetoric of figures close to Trump certainly suggests something similar could be afoot here.

In mid-February of the next year, soon after the designations were revealed, Elon Musk&nbsp;</span><a href="https://thehill.com/policy/international/5153929-mexican-drug-cartel-terrorist-organizations-musk-rubio-trump/" style="text-decoration: none;"><span>commented</span></a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> on social media that designating groups as FTOs “means they’re eligible for drone strikes”.

It deployed additional U.S. troops to the southern border, where Defense Secretary Hegseth, among others, paid them a visit. It dispatched military aircraft to deport migrants to countries of origin in Latin America – precipitating a brief diplomatic crisis with Colombia in the process. In an unprecedented move, the administration began shipping migrants to the U.S. base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba – a location infamous for holding alleged terrorists apprehended in post-9/11 counter-terrorism operations. In the 1990s, a Guantánamo facility was used to house tens of thousands of migrants picked up at sea en route to the U.S., but not migrants brought from the U.S. The White House&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/expanding-migrant-operations-center-at-naval-station-guantanamo-bay-to-full-capacity/" style="text-decoration: none;"><span>memorandum</span></a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> directing the use of Guantánamo to detain migrants claimed it was necessary to halt the alleged “border invasion”.</span></p>

By contrast, the Trump administration’s iterations are ostentatiously theatrical. The Bush administration conducted its rendition of alleged terrorists through the CIA under covert action authorities – meaning that the U.S. hand was not intended to be seen nor acknowledged. In contrast, the Trump administration has disseminated slickly produced videos of its rendition flights to El Salvador, and Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, posed for the cameras while visiting CECOT kitted out in paramilitary gear and a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/style/kristi-noem-venezuela-prison-rolex-watch.html" style="text-decoration: none;"><span>$50,000 Rolex</span></a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/style/kristi-noem-venezuela-prison-rolex-watch.html"><span> watch</span></a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">.

The uses of force cloaked in such language have been limited to detentions and renditions. But a change may be coming. The Trump administration appears to be setting the stage – almost literally – for the use of military force in Mexico against drug cartels.&nbsp;</span></p>

      <p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">There are several plausible explanations for why the Trump administration has repurposed the terrorism framing in these ways.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">First, labelling perceived threats as terrorists or alien enemies unlocks otherwise unavailable statutory powers. For example, members of foreign terrorist organisations who are not U.S. citizens are inadmissible to and in certain circumstances removable from the U.S. Similarly, the Alien Enemies Act confers broad authority to deport the citizens of the designated enemy with only limited judicial review.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Secondly, there may be a political benefit as well: labelling deemed adversaries as terrorists or terrorist sympathisers may help cow opposition from members of Congress and thus provide it with greater room for manoeuvre. It may also help with the public. Immigration remains one of the issues where President Trump’s policies enjoy the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/policy/trump-foreign-policy-approval-voters-poll-c0c29dd0?mod=hp_lead_pos10" style="text-decoration: none;"><span>highest approval</span></a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Thirdly, the invocation of counter-terrorism and wartime authorities also helps prepare the political ground for actual U.S. hostilities with drug trafficking organisations.

But historically courts act in a way that is piecemeal and reactive, and they are reluctant to challenge the executive branch on national security matters. They cannot be relied on to place strong safeguards on this second coming of the war on terror.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.3900000000000001; margin-bottom: 8pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">That job will fall first and foremost to the U.S. Congress. While Trump’s supporters outnumber his opponents in Congress, that does not mean that those with concerns about the new “war on terror” lack tools for reining it in. Even if they find it difficult to enact new legal safeguards, they can prepare draft legislation to rally political opposition and educate the U.S. public about the risks the administration’s actions pose both at home and abroad. Examples include recent&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/baltimore/news/maryland-wife-van-hollen-abrego-garcia-el-salvador-deported-ice-supreme-court/" style="text-decoration: none;"><span>efforts</span></a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> by members of Congress to highlight the case of Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man the administration sent to CECOT due to an “</span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/deportation-trump-salvador-maryland-abrego-garcia-3dc3f81c866fb7decb1e65123fa51aa7" style="text-decoration: none;"><span>administrative error</span></a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">”. These include Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen’s&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.vanhollen.senate.gov/news/press-releases/van-hollen-requests-meeting-with-president-bukele-to-discuss-return-of-kilmar-abrego-garcia-announces-intent-to-travel-to-el-salvador-this-week-if-abrego-garcia-is-not-returned" style="text-decoration: none;"><span>announcement</span></a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> of his intent to travel to El Salvador if Abrego Garcia is not returned (Van Hollen represents the state of Maryland, where Abrego Garcia was living), and collective steps by some members to legislatively oppose&nbsp;</span><a href="https://castro.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/reps-castro-garcia-velazquez-lead-resolution-opposing-us-military-action-against-mexico" style="text-decoration: none;"><span>U.S. military operations</span></a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> in Mexico.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.3900000000000001; margin-bottom: 8pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 13.999999999999998pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Legislators should not be intimidated by the administration’s cynical attempts to wield issues of migration, crime and fentanyl abuse as political weapons, even when the executive branch deploys the terrorism trope. Instead, members of Congress should highlight the dangers represented by the growing, unchecked concentration of power in the executive branch. They should explain how this stands to make the U.S. public less safe and less free, including by driving the U.S. into an absurd and unnecessary war. They should remind their fellow politicians and the public that elective wars tend not to wear well in practice or politically – and that political courage now can both set them up to look good in hindsight and help stem years of future costs.</span></p>

Finally, they delve into how democratic resilience can be fostered and what can be done to reverse democratic backsliding.</span></p><p></p><p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">Click here to listen on</span><a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/war-peace/id1479721943" style="text-decoration: none;"><span> Apple Podcasts</span></a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> or&nbsp;</span><a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2t6xtmUgfYjpQsm5QcuqPI" style="text-decoration: none;"><span>Spotify</span></a><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">.</span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.7999999999999998; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-top: 0pt;"><em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">For more, check out our&nbsp;</span></em><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia" style="text-decoration: none;"><em><span>Europe and Central Asia</span></em></a><em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: #000000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 11pt; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"> regional page.</span></em></p>

      <p>On Saturday, April 12, American and Iranian officials will restart talks over curbing Tehran’s nuclear program. The talks come after U.S. President Donald Trump sent a letter, in early March, to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei proposing negotiations. “We have a very big meeting,” the president said in announcing the talks. “We’ll see what can happen.”</p><p>There are reasons to hope that Trump’s overtures will succeed. The president has an almost instinctive love of dealmaking, and he has said he wants to make Iran prosperous again. But there are also reasons to be trepidatious. Even as they have embraced talks, Trump’s officials have upped the pressure on Tehran. The administration has doubled down on enforcing sanctions—an approach seemingly aimed at bankrupting Iran—and launched airstrikes on the Iranian-backed Houthis in Yemen. And Trump himself has even given Iran a tight two-month deadline to reach an agreement about its nuclear program. If the two sides fail, he has explicitly threatened to attack the country.</p><p>No one should want a war between Iran and the United States. If Washington strikes Tehran’s nuclear facilities, it might set back the program temporarily. But Iran could then double down on its efforts to go nuclear. Iran would also immediately respond with regional attacks of its own, further roiling the Middle East. There is a reason why even Trump has said that “everybody agrees that doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious.”</p><p>The full article can be read on the <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/case-trump-tehran-strategy">Foreign Affairs</a> website.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/latin-america-caribbean/south-america/brazil"><strong>BRAZIL</strong></a> &nbsp;Former President Jair Bolsonaro spoke to a rally of thousands in Sao Paulo Sunday, demanding pardons for all those accused of trying to overthrow President Luiz Inácio “Lula” da Silva’s government in early 2023. The Supreme Court announced in late February that Bolsonaro and 33 others, including several generals, will soon stand trial on charges of attempting a coup. Bolsonaro’s Partido Liberal is trying to pass a law granting amnesty to those who stormed federal buildings after Lula’s inauguration. At the demonstration, Bolsonaro compared himself to U.S. President Donald Trump and far-right French politician Marine Le Pen, saying all three have endured persecution for their political ideas. Crisis Group expert Renata Segura says the trial – whatever its outcome – will loom large in Brazilian politics as the 2026 presidential campaign draws near. Authorities have barred Bolsonaro from running until 2030, but he is expected to try anyway. Meanwhile, the trial will likely energise Bolsonaro’s defenders, at a time when Lula’s approval ratings have dropped.</p><p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/east-mediterranean-mena/israelpalestine"><strong>GAZA</strong></a> &nbsp;UN Secretary-General António Guterres sharply criticised Israel’s actions in Gaza Tuesday, saying “the floodgates of horror have reopened” due to its total blockade of the strip. For over a month, Israel has prevented food, fuel, medicine and other supplies from entering the enclave, vowing to keep doing so until Hamas releases all the hostages still in its hands. Seven UN agencies released a joint statement Monday calling for a renewed ceasefire and highlighting critical breakdowns in food distribution and health care as the blockade continues. Crisis Group expert Richard Gowan says Guterres has consistently been outspoken about the scale of suffering among Gaza’s Palestinians, but so far with little effect on Israeli policy. The UN needs Washington and other powerful capitals to press Israel to let more aid into the strip and restore the truce.</p><p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/united-states"><strong>U.S.</strong></a><strong>-</strong><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/gulf-and-arabian-peninsula/iran"><strong>IRAN</strong></a> &nbsp;The U.S. and Iran are due to hold high-level talks about the Islamic Republic's nuclear program in Oman this coming Saturday. The two sides have been at odds over this subject since 2018, during President Donald Trump’s first term, when he withdrew the U.S. from the deal struck between Tehran and world powers three years earlier. There are conflicting narratives about the format of the new discussions: Iranian officials insist they will be indirect, while Trump has described them as direct. The meeting will likely reveal gaps between the two sides’ expectations, which may be so large that dialogue stalls. But the mere fact of the talks is important, says Crisis Group expert Ali Vaez, as finding sufficient common ground could help the sides scope out the parameters of more substantive negotiations to be pursued down the road.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/east-mediterranean-mena/israelpalestine"><strong>GAZA</strong></a> &nbsp;Israel this week expanded its offensive in Gaza, including ground operations in several cities and creation of a new military corridor between Rafah and Khan Younis. The renewed assault has killed over 1,300 Palestinians since 18 March, exacerbating displacement and hunger amid a month-long total siege. On 30 March, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel plans to take control of the strip in preparation for the Palestinians’ “voluntary migration” elsewhere. Crisis Group expert Amjad Iraqi says Israeli officials' statements suggest that their objectives go beyond compelling Hamas to hand over the 59 remaining Israeli hostages and entail rendering Gaza uninhabitable and threatening it with depopulation. Outside powers should urgently apply pressure to restore a ceasefire.</p><p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/latin-america-caribbean/caribbean/haiti"><strong>HAITI</strong></a> &nbsp;Thousands took to the streets of Port-au-Prince on Wednesday to protest spiralling gang violence and the government’s failure to protect civilians. Armed gangs now reportedly control 85 per cent of the capital and are expanding their reach into other parts of the country. On Monday, gang attacks in the city of Mirebalais enabled more than 500 inmates to escape from jail, while a government-leased helicopter used to transport security forces was disabled near the city the same day. Crisis Group expert Diego Da Rin says gangs are likely to take full control of Port-au-Prince if decisive action is not taken soon. Haiti’s foreign partners must provide an immediate increase in security assistance that corresponds to the gravity of the situation. Otherwise, gangs could overthrow the transitional government and install their own authorities.</p><p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/east-mediterranean-mena/lebanon"><strong>LEBANON</strong></a> &nbsp;Two rockets were launched from Lebanon toward Israel last Friday. Hizbollah denied involvement, as it had done after a similar volley six days earlier. Nevertheless, last Friday Israel carried out airstrikes on targets in southern Lebanon, which killed several people. It also hit an alleged Hizbollah drone storage facility in Beirut, its first attack on the Lebanese capital since the November ceasefire. On Tuesday, Israel again struck Beirut, killing two Hizbollah members and two civilians. Under the ceasefire’s terms, the Lebanese state must hold accountable anyone firing at Israel from Lebanon, says Crisis Group expert David Wood. But it needs sufficient time to identify the culprits. Israel’s swift retaliations do not help; instead, they risk precipitating a slide back into full-scale conflict.</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/north-africa/egypt"><strong>EGYPT</strong></a><strong>-</strong><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/east-mediterranean-mena/israelpalestine"><strong>GAZA</strong></a> &nbsp;Cairo reportedly floated a proposal this week for restoring the ceasefire in Gaza, as the Palestinian death toll from Israel’s renewed offensive in the strip topped 800. According to the plan, which Egyptian security sources say Hamas and the U.S. have accepted, hostilities would again pause, and Hamas would release five of the remaining 59 hostages each week. At the end of the second week, Israel would begin withdrawing its forces from all of Gaza, in accordance with the terms of the original January truce agreement’s second phase. Neither Israel nor Hamas has directly commented on the scheme. Crisis Group expert Riccardo Fabiani says Egypt is anxious to get the ceasefire back in place. The longer the war goes on, Egyptian officials fear, the more likely Israel is to try pushing Palestinians out of Gaza into Sinai and the more Suez Canal revenue Egypt will lose due to attacks by Yemen’s Houthis on Red Sea shipping.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/horn-africa/sudan"><strong>SUDAN</strong></a><strong> &nbsp;</strong>The Sudanese army announced Wednesday it had retaken central Khartoum, including the presidential palace and the airport, from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Crisis Group expert Shewit Woldemichael says&nbsp;it&nbsp;is a major turning point in the country’s bloody civil war. The RSF had held much of the capital since early after the conflict began in mid-April 2023. Recapturing Khartoum greatly bolsters the army’s claim to be the legitimate national authority and deals the RSF a heavy blow. Peace is not yet at hand, however. The RSF still controls swathes of territory in Darfur and Kordofan, where conflict rages.&nbsp;Fighting is also spilling into neighbouring Chad and South Sudan, heightening tensions in the region. Diplomats should urgently push both the Sudanese army and the RSF to engage in negotiations, putting a peaceful resolution over continued military escalation.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/united-states"><strong>UNITED STATES</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong> Congressional Democrats called upon top Trump administration officials to resign this week, following publication of an article showing the officials discussing the 15 March U.S. bombing of Houthi-linked targets in Yemen in a Signal group chat, outside the government’s formal channels. A journalist was included in the chat, apparently in error. Crisis Group expert Brian Finucane says the incident suggests a further breakdown of U.S. decision-making processes about matters of war and peace. The U.S. Constitution gives Congress, not the executive branch, the power to declare war, but legislators have never authorised military action against the Houthis. Nor has the administration publicly explained the legal basis for strikes in this instance, when the substantive debate seems to have occurred in an informal executive branch forum.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/great-lakes/democratic-republic-congo"><strong>DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO</strong></a> &nbsp;Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi met with Rwandan President Paul Kagame Tuesday in Doha, Qatar, with the two leaders agreeing in their final statement on the need for the M23 rebel group to halt its offensive in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. It was their first tête-à-tête in over a year. On Wednesday, however, the M23 moved to seize the strategic town of Walikale, opening the way to Kisangani, one of the country’s largest cities. Crisis Group expert Richard Moncrieff says it is as yet unclear whether the M23, now in control of more territory than ever in the mineral-rich east, will stop its onslaught, which has already killed thousands.</p><p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/east-mediterranean-mena/israelpalestine"><strong>GAZA</strong></a> &nbsp;Israel broke a two-month ceasefire Tuesday, launching devastating airstrikes across Gaza that have so far killed at least 600 Palestinians. The Israeli army also moved Wednesday to retake the Netzarim corridor that bisects the strip. The fresh offensive comes after Hamas rejected Israeli and U.S. efforts to prolong the ceasefire’s first phase, insisting that talks advance to deal with a full Israeli withdrawal and Gaza’s reconstruction, as the parties had agreed in January. Crisis Group expert Amjad Iraqi says Israeli officials are signalling an even more aggressive campaign to dismantle Gaza’s surviving governing infrastructure and maybe to annex parts of the territory, expelling the Palestinians living there. Returning to the original ceasefire parameters is paramount.</p><p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/russia-internal"><strong>RUSSIA</strong></a><strong>-</strong><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/eastern-europe/ukraine"><strong>UKRAINE</strong></a> &nbsp;Russia and Ukraine traded more fire this week, with intense Russian drone strikes on two hospitals and other civilian buildings just hours after Russian President Vladimir Putin had agreed to halt attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure in a Tuesday telephone call with U.S. President Donald Trump. On Wednesday, Trump spoke with Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy, later expressing optimism that a full ceasefire could be near. Crisis Group expert Olga Oliker says the increased interest in ceasefire talks may signal a step forward, but given how little sign Moscow has given that it is ready to offer concessions, there is no guarantee that other steps toward a lasting ceasefire will follow.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/south-asia/bangladesh"><strong>BANGLADESH</strong></a> &nbsp;The World Food Programme announced this week it would chop food aid for almost one million Rohingya refugees by more than half to just $6 per person per month, starting on 1 April. The reason is a severe funding shortfall, caused in part by the Trump administration’s suspension of most U.S. foreign assistance. The U.S. has been the largest donor to the Rohingya crisis response, contributing more than half of the almost $600 million that was raised in 2024. The cuts are likely to increase pressure on the Bangladeshi government to allow more livelihood opportunities for Rohingya to reduce their dependence on aid. Crisis Group expert Thomas Kean says Rohingya armed groups and criminal gangs, which have lately stepped up recruitment in camps in Bangladesh, will likely take advantage as the refugees’ hardship deepens.</p><p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/russia-internal"><strong>RUSSIA</strong></a><strong>-</strong><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/eastern-europe/ukraine"><strong>UKRAINE</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong> Kyiv accepted a U.S. proposal this week for a 30-day ceasefire in its battle to fend off Russia’s 2022 invasion. At a press conference Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said “the idea in itself is the right one” but pointed to “nuances” that he said required “painstaking research”. Among the questions he raised were whether Ukraine would keep receiving Western arms shipments during the truce and what would happen afterward. The Trump administration’s envoy, Steve Witkoff, met with Putin in Moscow that evening. Crisis Group expert Oleg Ignatov says the Russian president’s reaction shows he does not want a ceasefire at present, at least not without guarantees of gains for the Kremlin, but he does want to keep the door open to dialogue with his U.S. counterpart.</p><p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/east-mediterranean-mena/syria"><strong>SYRIA</strong></a> &nbsp;People throughout Syria celebrated Monday’s landmark agreement between the interim government and the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, which hold large parts of the country’s north east, to integrate the latter’s military and civilian institutions into the Syrian state by year’s end. The pact came at a critical moment, as Damascus dealt with the fallout from deadly clashes on the Mediterranean coast that have exacerbated inter-communal tensions and brought an international backlash. Crisis Group expert Dareen Khalifa says the agreement could prove a turning point in efforts to reunify the war-torn country, though key details remain to be worked out. Concerted diplomacy to that end will be needed in the months ahead. &nbsp;</p>

      <p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/east-mediterranean-mena/israelpalestine"><strong>GAZA</strong></a><strong> &nbsp;</strong>At a Tuesday summit in Cairo, the Arab League endorsed an Egyptian scheme for reconstructing Gaza after the 2023-2025 war, geared toward establishing a Palestinian state there and in the West Bank. The plan, which is partly intended to counter U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal that the U.S. “take over” the strip, emptying it of its Palestinian population, was welcomed by the Palestinian Authority and Hamas but rejected by Israel. Crisis Group expert Amjad Iraqi says the document is vague about key political and security questions. Nonetheless, it offers a starting point for diplomatic conversations about getting to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza and a sustainable vision for its recovery.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/south-asia/pakistan"><strong>PAKISTAN-</strong></a><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/south-asia/afghanistan"><strong>AFGHANISTAN</strong></a> &nbsp;Clashes between Pakistani and Afghan forces have continued unabated since Monday along the disputed border between Pakistan’s Khyber district and Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province. Fighting in the area has been occurring sporadically since mid-February, though it has now increased in intensity, with both sides using heavy weaponry to fire on military installations.&nbsp;The skirmishes were sparked by Taliban attempts to build outposts for their troops on the frontier as well as Islamabad’s refusal to reopen the vital Torkham crossing, which has been shut since 21 February, exacting a heavy economic toll on both countries. If differences are not resolved, the confrontation risks escalating, says Crisis Group expert Ibraheem Bahiss. Each country accuses the other of harbouring militants who stage deadly cross-border raids.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/united-states"><strong>U.S.-</strong></a><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/latin-america-caribbean/central-america/mexico"><strong>MEXICO</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong> The White House announced Thursday it would suspend tariffs on Mexican imports, following a telephone conversation between Presidents Donald Trump and Claudia Sheinbaum. The 25 per cent levies, which had taken effect two days earlier, are now on hold until 2 April. The Trump administration first threatened the measures (along with comparable trade penalties on Canada) in early February, saying the two U.S. neighbours have been lax in interdicting shipments of the illegal drug fentanyl and in curbing migration. Mexicans were confounded by the tariffs’ imposition, says Crisis Group expert David Mora. Sheinbaum had already done a great deal to respond to U.S. requests, sending 10,000 additional troops to the country’s northern border, transferring 29 drug kingpins to U.S. custody and stepping up raids on fentanyl labs. Much of the Mexican public has rallied behind Sheinbaum, who has an 85 per cent approval rating.&nbsp;</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/latin-america-caribbean/andes/colombia"><strong>COLOMBIA</strong></a> &nbsp;Tensions continued to heighten in Colombia's Catatumbo region, along the Venezuela border, as the leftist National Liberation Army (ELN) insurgency carried out a string of bombings near the city of Cúcuta on 20 February, hitting police stations and other public buildings. These attacks come just a month after the ELN launched another assault that left 63 dead and more than 80,000 displaced. Crisis Group expert Elizabeth Dickinson says the ELN is moving aggressively to consolidate its hold on the border region's key trafficking corridors and expel a rival armed group, the 33rd Front. The violence has severe consequences for civilians, several of whom have been assassinated. The widespread planting of landmines is also preventing displaced families from returning home.</p><p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/horn-africa/sudan"><strong>SUDAN</strong></a> &nbsp;The Sudanese army continued to gain ground from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). On Sunday, the army announced it had seized al-Gitaina, south of the capital Khartoum, and broken a two-year siege of al-Obeid in North Kordofan. The same day, the RSF signed a charter with allied armed groups, aiming to establish a parallel government. Despite the RSF’s setbacks, no end to the conflict is in sight, says Crisis Group expert Shewit Woldemichael. &nbsp;The two main belligerents are looking to further entrench themselves in their respective zones of influence. Mediation is unlikely while the army is pushing to retake Khartoum. Outside powers should nonetheless look for opportunities to de-escalate the conflict and work hard for its eventual resolution.</p><p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/east-mediterranean-mena/syria" target="_blank"><strong>SYRIA</strong></a> &nbsp;The interim government convened a national dialogue conference in Damascus on Tuesday to chart a path for Syria’s political transition following the Assad regime’s collapse in December. While the interim government has pledged an inclusive transition, critics voiced concern about the limited participation and lack of transparency in the conference. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, which control much of Syria’s north east, were excluded from the talks. Crisis Group expert Nanar Hawach says the conference ended up being a largely symbolic exercise. For Syria’s transition to succeed, the interim government should ensure that the political process is based on maximum transparency, inclusion and participation.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/great-lakes/democratic-republic-congo" target="_blank"><strong>DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO</strong></a> &nbsp;The Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group seized Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu province, on Sunday, prompting a looting spree by residents in shops, markets and warehouses storing humanitarian supplies. This follows the rebels’ seizure in January of Goma - the capital of North Kivu province. They now seem determined to continue their advance in the country’s east. Meanwhile, on Saturday, 15 February, Angolan President João Lourenço stepped down as mediator between Kigali and Kinshasa. Crisis Group expert Pauline Bax says regional and Western countries should work together to press Rwanda, which has thousands of troops in the area supporting the M23, to withdraw from the eastern DR Congo and put measures in place to relieve a growing humanitarian crisis. The M23’s offensive in the east has killed over 3,000 people and displaced around 700,000.</p><p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/caucasus/russia-internal"><strong>RUSSIA-EU</strong></a> &nbsp;On Wednesday, the EU agreed to impose new sanctions on Russia days before the third anniversary of its all-out invasion of Ukraine. The sanctions package came as the U.S. and Russia held talks in Saudi Arabia about ending the war and starting a new era of U.S.-Russian partnership. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country would not accept a peace agreement that did not consider Ukraine’s interests, and Trump falsely blamed Ukraine for starting the war with Russia. Crisis Group experts Oleg Ignatov and Lucian Kim say that the contrast between Russia-U.S. rapprochement and EU sanctions illustrates a deepening rift in translatlantic relations.</p><p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/east-mediterranean-mena/israelpalestine" target="_blank"><strong>WEST BANK</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong> The Israeli army demolished dozens of residential buildings in Tulkarem refugee camp on Tuesday as part of a deadly campaign in the occupied West Bank that has killed at least 44 Palestinians, uprooted 45,000 and caused the largest mass displacement of Palestinians in the territory since 1967. Crisis Group expert Tahani Mustafa says this military operation comes as Israel appears increasingly emboldened to pursue West Bank annexation, applying tactics that recall its operations in Gaza. The latest Israeli raids in the West Bank, which started two days after the ceasefire in Gaza, have mostly targeted refugee camps in Jenin and Tulkarem.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/latin-america-caribbean/andes/ecuador"><strong>ECUADOR</strong></a> &nbsp;Voters went to the polls Sunday for the first round of the presidential election, with the incumbent Daniel Noboa and his leading challenger Luisa González finishing in a near tie. The two will now compete in an April runoff. Election day was largely peaceful, with no major incident, despite the severe criminal violence that has gripped the country in recent years. Both Noboa and González raised questions of possible fraud, but electoral observation missions from the European Union and Organization of American States promptly affirmed that the balloting was transparent and well-run. Crisis Group expert Glaeldys González Calanche says the results highlight Ecuador’s profound political polarisation, with opinion split between right- and left-leaning blocs. Whoever wins the second round will need to negotiate with the opposition to govern effectively and to curb the growing power of organised crime.</p><p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/eastern-europe/ukraine"><strong>UKRAINE</strong></a> &nbsp;U.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth sent shock waves through Europe this week when he said the NATO membership Ukraine has long sought is “unrealistic”. Together with news that U.S. President Donald Trump may meet soon with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the statement fuelled speculation that Washington and Moscow will negotiate over Ukraine’s fate without consulting Kyiv and its European backers. Crisis Group expert Lucian Kim says the Ukrainian government looks to be in a precarious position. It has long seemed unlikely that Ukraine could achieve war goals like restoring its pre-2014 borders. Security guarantees it has wanted from a negotiated settlement – like getting a spot in NATO or foreign troops stationed on its territory – may also be out of reach. But discarding these possibilities before talks begin gives the U.S. a weaker hand vis-à-vis the Kremlin. Though Hegseth later walked back some of his remarks, and other U.S. officials, including Vice President JD Vance, made contradictory comments about keeping all options on the table, jitters remain.</p><p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/united-states"><strong>U.S.</strong></a><strong>-</strong><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/east-mediterranean-mena"><strong>MIDDLE EAST</strong></a> &nbsp;President Donald Trump’s incendiary proposal to remove Palestinians from Gaza and take over the enclave continued to reverberate this week, as Jordan’s King Abdullah II became the first Arab leader to visit the White House following the November election. Trump has said the Palestinians could resettle in Jordan and Egypt, indicating that he might use the considerable U.S. assistance that goes to both countries to press their governments to acquiesce. Keen to avoid friction with his country’s biggest patron, the Jordanian king did not publicly confront Trump, says Crisis Group expert Michael Wahid Hanna. But popular outrage at the notion of forcibly displacing Palestinians is widespread in the Arab world, particularly with the scale of devastation in Gaza becoming clearer as the tenuous ceasefire proceeds. Sources indicated Wednesday that Egyptian President Abdelfattah al-Sisi will decline White House invitations if the idea remains on the table, a sign of growing pushback.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/great-lakes/democratic-republic-congo"><strong>DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO</strong></a><strong> &nbsp;</strong>Despite the Congo River Alliance coalition – headed by the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group – declaring a unilateral ceasefire to go into effect Tuesday, it seized more territory in the country’s east, including the city of Nyabibwe, on Wednesday. UN agencies reported that around 3,000 people were killed and hundreds of thousands displaced in fighting around the major city of Goma last week with cases of sexual and gender-based violence soaring. Crisis Group expert Richard Moncrieff says a lasting ceasefire requires more vigorous regional diplomacy and a firmer international stance against Rwanda’s aggression.</p><p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/east-mediterranean-mena/israelpalestine"><strong>ISRAEL-PALESTINE</strong></a> &nbsp;Meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump proposed that the U.S. “take over” the Gaza Strip and resettle its 2.2 million Palestinians elsewhere, drawing fierce international condemnation, including from Arab states. Meanwhile, Israel continued an offensive in the northern West Bank, targeting Palestinian militants but displacing and harming many civilians. Crisis Group expert Amjad Iraqi says Trump’s statement could undermine the fragile ceasefire deal in Gaza and embolden Israel’s far-right government to try pushing Palestinians out of one or both of the occupied territories.</p><p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/europe-central-asia/eastern-europe/ukraine"><strong>UKRAINE</strong></a><strong> </strong>Amid heightened anticipation that peace negotiations may start soon, President Volodomyr Zelenskyy announced Tuesday that he is prepared to talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin, who last week also signalled readiness for negotiations, but not directly with Zelenskyy. With the new U.S. administration saying it wants to help to end the war, Moscow and Kyiv have both been trying to make battlefield advances to ensure a better negotiating position, says Crisis Group expert Lucian Kim. Now almost in its fourth year, the war has killed over 45,000 Ukrainian soldiers and approximately 200,000 Russian soldiers, according to Zelenskyy.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/east-mediterranean-mena/lebanon"><strong>LEBANON</strong></a> &nbsp;Violence erupted at the Lebanese-Israeli border this week, though the fragile truce between Hizbollah and Israel is largely holding. Last Friday, citing security concerns, the Israeli government announced that it would not complete its troop withdrawal from southern Lebanon by Sunday, as required under the ceasefire deal struck in November. Starting on Sunday, displaced residents attempted to return to villages that remained under Israeli occupation, coming under Israeli fire. Israel killed 24 people over two days and wounded well over 100 more. Lebanon has accepted 18 February as the new pullout deadline. Crisis Group expert David Wood says Israel should remove its soldiers promptly, lest their presence precipitate a slide back into conflict. A protracted occupation also risks burnishing Hizbollah's claims that Israel will never leave Lebanon unless compelled by the group's armed resistance.</p><p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/horn-africa/sudan"><strong>SUDAN</strong></a> &nbsp;The prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, Karim Khan, announced Monday that he is seeking arrest warrants for individuals responsible for atrocities in Sudan’s West Darfur region, urging accountability for war crimes including sexual violence. Fighting between the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the Sudanese army has continued in Darfur and other parts of Sudan, with the RSF intensifying its assault on North Darfur’s capital El Fasher and the army reportedly making advances in Khartoum. Crisis Group expert Shewit Woldemichael says neither side has a path to military victory. Without urgent diplomacy by external powers, especially those with a stake in the conflict, human suffering is likely to worsen in Sudan.</p><p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/multilateral-diplomacy"><strong>UNITED NATIONS</strong></a> &nbsp;Two Israeli laws that curtail the operations of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) in Gaza and the West Bank took effect Thursday. The legislation imposes a de facto ban on UNRWA, the body responsible for helping Palestinian refugees, by outlawing its work in Israel (including in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem, where its West Bank field headquarters is located) and barring Israeli officials from interacting with its staff. Crisis Group expert Daniel Forti says the ban will cut off a lifeline for Gaza’s population, which UNRWA supplies with humanitarian aid and basic services, and risk destabilising the Palestinian enclave during the fragile first phase of the truce between Israel and Hamas. The laws will also have a severe economic impact, as UNRWA employs nearly 17,000 Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/latin-america-caribbean/andes/colombia"><strong>COLOMBIA</strong></a> &nbsp;Peace negotiations between the government and the largest remaining insurgency, the National Liberation Army (ELN), collapsed in mid-January, after the armed group launched an offensive in the Catatumbo region along the border with Venezuela. In coordinated attacks, the ELN assassinated dozens of social leaders and ex-combatants of the former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which it accused of being sympathetic to the Frente 33, a rival armed group, displacing over 30,000 civilians in the process. Crisis Group expert Elizabeth Dickinson says the violence marks a dangerous inflection point in Colombia's conflict. Tensions among armed groups could erupt into all-out fighting along various fronts. The government should use channels of communication it has established through years of peace efforts with the armed groups to help stop the crisis from spiralling out of control.</p><p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/latin-america-caribbean/caribbean/haiti"><strong>HAITI</strong></a> &nbsp;In a report released Wednesday, UN Secretary-General António Guterres warned that Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, risks being completely overrun by gangs unless international actors urgently bolster support for the Kenya-led multinational mission in the country. Over the weekend, Kenya deployed 217 additional police, adding to around 150 officers sent by Guatemala and an advance team of seven soldiers dispatched by El Salvador earlier this month. But while the reinforcements provide much-needed support to Haiti’s overstretched police force, says Crisis Group expert Diego Da Rin, the mission remains far short of its planned 2,500 personnel. As the UN Security Council weighs the possibility of switching to a UN peacekeeping mission, external actors must act quickly and decisively to enhance support for the current mission – or it will become increasingly difficult for anyone to curb the escalating gang violence.</p><p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/south-east-asia/myanmar"><strong>MYANMAR</strong></a> &nbsp;A China-brokered ceasefire between the regime and the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), an ethnic Kokang armed group in northern Shan State, took effect on 18 January. Under the deal, the MNDAA has reportedly agreed to withdraw its forces from Lashio, an important town it seized from regime forces last August, by this coming June. China has reopened trade gates on the Kokang border, which it had closed to press the MNDAA to halt its military actions. Crisis Group expert Richard Horsey says the ceasefire demonstrates China’s leverage over both the regime and the MNDAA. But it could be a delaying tactic by the MNDAA aimed at easing Chinese pressure without immediately handing over Lashio. The border reopening offers much-needed relief to Kokang residents facing shortages of goods and services but falls short of restoring broader Myanmar-China trade, most of which remains blocked.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/great-lakes/democratic-republic-congo"><strong>DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO</strong></a><strong> &nbsp;</strong>Government forces announced on Monday the recapture of several towns in North Kivu province, though the situation on the ground remains fluid as they fight M23 rebels for territory. The M23 had seized the strategic town of Masisi in early January. Fighting between the rebels, documented by the UN and others to be backed by Rwanda, and the Congolese army has intensified in North Kivu’s Lubero and Masisi territories since December. According to the UN, more than 100,000 people have been displaced by violence in the eastern DR Congo since the year began. Crisis Group expert Onesphore Sematumba says the M23 advances over recent weeks further complicate negotiations between Kinshasa and Kigali to end the conflict. Diplomats, including at the African Union, should step up support for the Angola-led mediation effort, which stalled last month.</p><p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/east-mediterranean-mena/israelpalestine"><strong>GAZA</strong></a> &nbsp;After fifteen months of war, Hamas and Israel reached a ceasefire and hostage-prisoner exchange deal Wednesday, meant to take effect Sunday. In the first of three planned stages, Hamas is to release 33 of the remaining hostages it took in October 2023, while Israel would free a number of Palestinian prisoners and gradually withdraw troops from the strip to enable displaced people to return. The deal also aims to significantly increase the amount of humanitarian aid getting into Gaza. Crisis Group expert Amjad Iraqi says the U.S. and regional powers need to keep pressing the parties to get the fragile agreement into the next phases, which provide for additional hostage-prisoner swaps, and to fulfil the humanitarian provisions for Gaza's starving population.</p><p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/east-mediterranean-mena/lebanon"><strong>LEBANON</strong></a><strong> &nbsp;</strong>On Monday, Lebanese lawmakers made a surprising choice of prime minister, Nawaf Salam, after filling the country’s years-long presidential vacuum on 9 January. Parliament elected army commander Joseph Aoun to the presidency, which had lain vacant since November 2022. Many observers then expected Najib Mikati, Hizbollah’s preferred choice, to become premier, given the group’s reluctant support for Aoun. Instead, most deputies backed Salam, a respected jurist considered outside Lebanon’s ruling class. Crisis Group expert David Wood says the two appointments offer hope for long overdue reform, though both leaders will need to secure buy-in from Hizbollah and other factions. Otherwise, Lebanon could descend into yet more political paralysis, starting during Salam’s efforts to form a government.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/central-africa/chad" target="_blank"><strong>CHAD</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong> The presidential guard killed eighteen people in the capital N’Djamena Wednesday, in what the government claimed was a foiled attack on the presidential palace. Crisis Group expert Enrica Picco says the circumstances are unclear, however, as the alleged assailants were carrying no firearms. The ambiguity surrounding the incident has further jangled nerves among city residents. In any case, the events are a sign that the authorities are on high alert, with heavier military deployments in N’Djamena in recent weeks. The government’s alleged support for the Rapid Support Forces in Sudan, coupled with tensions in its relations with traditional partner France, have reportedly sown divisions in the army, the president’s key support base.</p><p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/east-mediterranean-mena/israelpalestine" target="_blank"><strong>GAZA</strong></a> &nbsp;Israeli airstrikes continued throughout the strip this week, with the official Palestinian death toll since 7 October 2023 topping 46,000. Winter weather is exacerbating the desperate humanitarian crisis, leading to several deaths among the hundreds of thousands of displaced. Meanwhile, ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas, which had regained momentum last month with Qatari, Egyptian and U.S. mediation, appear to have stalled once more. Crisis Group expert Amjad Iraqi says Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has undermined truce talks by adding new demands and insisting on “total victory”, may be more amenable to a deal after the U.S. presidential inauguration, as Donald Trump’s team has encouraged. But a ceasefire will be insufficient to alleviate the suffering in Gaza without substantial pressure on Israel to allow in far more aid.</p><p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/united-states" target="_blank"><strong>U.S.</strong></a><strong>-</strong><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/horn-africa/sudan" target="_blank"><strong>SUDAN</strong></a> &nbsp;The U.S. State Department said Tuesday it had determined that the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) have committed genocide in the course of Sudan’s civil war. It has imposed sanctions on RSF leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as Hemedti, as well as seven RSF-owned companies and an unnamed person based in the United Arab Emirates for “their role in procuring weapons for the RSF”. The announcement followed a 2023 U.S. determination that both the RSF and the Sudanese army, the other main belligerent, had committed war crimes, while the RSF had also committed crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing. Concerning this week’s finding, Crisis Group expert Magnus Taylor says the RSF has undoubtedly perpetrated many heinous acts during the war, including mass killings targeted at certain ethnic groups. But how much U.S. sanctions will advance rather than hinder the immediate necessity of ending the horrific war is unclear. The army may use the genocide determination as justification for avoiding serious negotiations with the RSF, which in turn is unlikely to halt its ruinous military campaign.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/south-asia/afghanistan" target="_blank"><strong>AFGHANISTAN</strong></a> &nbsp;The Taliban-led economy ministry told NGOs last week that if they continue to employ Afghan women, the de facto authorities will revoke their licences and suspend their operations. The warning, coming weeks after another decree that barred women from getting medical training, suggests an impending crackdown on NGOs, including those delivering life-saving aid. Crisis Group expert Ibraheem Bahiss says these decisions put humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan at risk, as donors recoil at the tightening restrictions on women’s rights. Needs might soon be increasing, moreover, due to disputes with Pakistan over insurgent activity along the border, which could lead Islamabad to deport Afghan refugees, as it has done in the past. The Taliban should let humanitarian NGOs carry out their mission unfettered.</p><p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/east-mediterranean-mena/syria" target="_blank"><strong>SYRIA</strong></a> &nbsp;The caretaker government faced backlash this week after its education ministry floated curriculum changes that were widely perceived as imposing a conservative Islamist slant on teaching, raising concerns about the trajectory of governance. The criticism prompted the acting education minister to say curricula would largely remain unaltered pending review by specialist committees. The main amendments for the time being, the minister added, will pertain to removing symbols glorifying the Assad regime, adopting the new revolutionary flag and adjusting Islamic education courses. To avoid inflaming tensions that could endanger the post-Assad transition, says Crisis Group expert Dareen Khalifa, the new leaders should maintain a hands-off approach to education. Any divisive decision could be seen as undermining their pledge to safeguard Syria’s social and cultural diversity.</p><p><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/united-states" target="_blank"><strong>UNITED STATES</strong></a> &nbsp;A pickup truck plowed into New Year’s revelers in New Orleans, Louisiana early Wednesday morning, killing fourteen and injuring many more. The driver, a U.S. army veteran, wounded two police officers before being killed himself in a subsequent shootout. Authorities disabled several improvised explosive devices both inside the truck and in the immediate vicinity. President Joe Biden said the attacker appears to have been “inspired by ISIS” (an ISIS flag was also found inside the truck). In Las Vegas, Nevada, another truck laden with fuel canisters and firework mortars blew up outside the Trump International Hotel Wednesday, killing the driver (a serving U.S. soldier) and injuring seven bystanders. It so far appears the two incidents are unrelated. It is critical, says Crisis Group expert Michael Wahid Hanna, that U.S. politicians allow the investigations to proceed without speculating or instigating panic. The decades-long war on terror shows the pitfalls of leveraging public unease for political ends.</p>

      <p>In late March, Ahmad al-Shara, Syria’s new leader, introduced a caretaker government that would supervise the country’s transition from five decades of dictatorial rule. He gave some cabinet positions to figures outside his Islamist milieu, including naming a Christian woman minister of social affairs, a Kurdish official minister of education, a Druze minister for agriculture, and an Alawite minister for transport. Those appointments reflect the pressure Shara is under to demonstrate to Arab and Western governments—and to the Syrian people—that he can build an inclusive government that represents the country’s religious and ethnic minorities. It is a challenge made all the harder by an eruption of bloodshed in March in which fighters affiliated with Shara’s government (but not under its direction) targeted minority Alawites in the west of the country, killing hundreds.</p><p>Ever since Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, Shara’s rebel group, swept down from northwest Syria in December 2024 and helped topple the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, outside powers have wondered whether an Islamist such as Shara can govern such a large and diverse country. With Turkish backing, HTS operated in northwestern Idlib Province through much of the Syrian civil war and managed to extend its sway over the territory. But it’s unclear if what worked in Idlib will work in Syria writ large. Doubts also hang over the sincerity of Shara’s professed ideological moderation. The group began as zealous jihadis allied with al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (also known as ISIS). But during the 2010s, HTS split from both al-Qaeda and ISIS, making it clear that its struggle was local and particular to Syria. By 2020, HTS was fighting pitched battles against al-Qaeda-aligned forces and ISIS in Idlib. After ousting Assad, Shara reached out to Arab and Western governments, assiduously presenting himself as a moderate who would protect the country’s religious and ethnic minorities.</p><p>For now, Shara holds the cards in Damascus. The temporary constitution stipulates that the interim government will be in place for five years before it stages presidential elections, which means he will be in power for the foreseeable future. The most powerful ministries remain in the hands of Shara’s allies, and he sits atop the executive. The temporary constitution, declared in March, recognizes a bill of rights, including freedom of belief and opinion and equality before the law. But it grants Shara tremendous latitude. He will fill the constitutional court and appoint one-third of parliamentary seats, while the remaining parliamentary seats will be selected by a high committee—made up of members appointed by him. At any time, he can declare a state of emergency and remove the weak institutional checks on his rule. Many Western officials are worried about the possibility of a return to a one-party state—much like that of the Assad regime. Many Syrians perceive Shara, correctly, as a radical pragmatist, willing to make concessions and abandon problematic commitments and alliances as long as such decisions accord with his relentless pursuit of power.</p><p>The full article can be read on the <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/syria/syrias-uncertain-new-order">Foreign Affairs</a> website.</p>

      <p><span lang="EN-GB">The Colombian government announced on 9 April a move that President Gustavo Petro had long promised to avoid: returning to the fumigation of coca. Today, there are&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.minjusticia.gov.co/Sala-de-prensa/Paginas/Resultados-monitoreo-cultivos-2023-no-son-ajenos-a-presion-global-por-aumento-de-demanda.aspx#:~:text=El%2048%25%20de%20la%20coca,hect%C3%A1reas%20en%20el%20territorio%20nacional."><span lang="EN-GB">more</span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> coca crops, the raw material for cocaine, than ever. Bogotá is under pressure from Washington to reverse the trend ahead of October, when the White House must decide whether to certify Colombia’s cooperation with the war on drugs.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB">The dilemma over fumigation demonstrates how the Trump administration’s hard line puts Latin American countries in a bind. Aerial spraying is illegal in Colombia, but Petro is the first president to have stopped manual fumigation. Failing to meet U.S. demands that it restart could end in devastating sanctions and budget cuts. But a campaign of forced coca eradication, even with the government’s promise of a low dose of the herbicide glyphosate, will exacerbate local conflict, undermine trust between rural communities and the military, and raise health concerns.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB">Petro is hoping to avoid a catastrophic result by choosing a bad option.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB">Colombian fears are justified. If the U.S. decertifies the country, the fallout would include an immediate end to roughly $70 million in annual U.S.-Colombia military cooperation; the end of training programs and credits to help buy defence systems; and potentially new tariffs and sanctions. The last time Colombia was decertified, in 1996, Washington even lobbied against providing it with development aid and loans from international financial institutions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB">Terminating a quarter-century of co-operation would seem counter to U.S. interests, given the extent of Washington’s&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47426#:~:text=Colombia%20and%20the%20United%20States,%2C%20trade%2C%20and%20economic%20development."><span lang="EN-GB">security partnership</span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> with Colombia. Recently, Washington has certified the country each year via agreements to improve on&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-US">a variety of security&nbsp;</span><span lang="EN-GB">indicators. But a senior Colombian military officer said, “everything is working against us” this time around. The Trump administration has found it easy to&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20p36e62gyo"><span lang="EN-GB">make an example</span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> of Petro, a left-wing leader who has clashed with the White House over migration and tariffs. The threat of ending military ties “is hovering over us like a giant stick, at a time when security is more challenging than ever”, the officer said.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB">Petro’s goal to eradicate 30,000 hectares this year (compared to a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.wradio.com.co/noticias/actualidad/duque-traza-meta-para-erradicar-manualmente-130000-hectareas-de-cultivos-ilicitos-en-2021/20210104/nota/4099229.aspx"><span lang="EN-GB">goal of 130,000</span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> under the past conservative administration) may not be enough to placate Trump. But it will be enough to heighten conflict in Colombia.

Past efforts led to violent clashes between the military and civilians. At times, civilians are compelled by armed groups to surround and in effect hold soldiers hostage until they agree to leave. In the past soldiers have been killed by landmines planted around coca fields by armed groups.</span></p><p><span lang="EN-GB">Fumigation will also not have any measurable effect on the booming global drug market. As Crisis Group has&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/latin-america-caribbean/colombia-ecuador-guatemala-honduras-mexico/108-curbing-violence-latin-america-drug-trafficking-hotspots"><span lang="EN-GB">written</span></a><span lang="EN-GB">, the supply chain is flexible and will pivot to fill supply gaps. In all likelihood, it will be Colombia’s conflict-affected communities who will pay the price of Washington’s demands.</span></p>

<p>On April 2, US President Donald Trump announced import tariffs – many above 40 percent, on goods from virtually every country – upending the global economy. Although now paused above a baseline 10 percent, except for China, these new tariffs illustrate the danger of pursuing economic reforms without regard for the impact on people’s human rights.</p><p>The promise to reshape the economy, which was central to Trump’s reelection campaign, tapped into a&nbsp;pervasive sense among many US voters that they were being financially cheated by wages not keeping up with rising prices. Economies should be transformed to ensure everyone can enjoy their rights to food, housing, health care, education, social security, and other economic, social and cultural rights: But Trump’s approach gives no evident consideration to these or any rights.</p><p>These new tariffs are so broad and arbitrary that many economists expect them to be&nbsp;inflationary, hurting those struggling the most. Yet not only is there no apparent plan to alleviate the immediate negative impact on people, the tariffs are also combined with policies already making things harder for many. The administration has&nbsp;slashed billions in spending and fired thousands of public employees,&nbsp;many of whom are Black, gutting programs vital for&nbsp;health care,&nbsp;education, and&nbsp;other&nbsp;rights. Meanwhile, the administration weakened&nbsp;anti-corruption&nbsp;rules and is pushing through&nbsp;tax cuts for the wealthiest, while&nbsp;rescinding rules that increased workers’ pay.</p><p>These measures run counter to an economy aligned with human rights – or a&nbsp;“human rights economy” – which assesses economic decision-making based on its impact on people’s welfare and the planet. A human rights economy is centered on quality public services such as  health care and education and income support at key life moments, while regulating companies and corporate power to prevent them from undermining rights.</p><p>A human rights approach to tariffs would carefully weigh the risk of increasing prices on necessities like food and housing against the potential benefits. Tariff policies should be part of a wider set of reforms that advances rights, such as by using any new revenue to strengthen public services and social security.</p><p>The tariffs also pose a significant risk to human rights in other countries, insofar as governments may end up sacrificing their own labor, health, and environmental protections in a bid for the US to remove the tariffs. This could exacerbate an already dire race to the bottom and compound harms caused by Trump&nbsp;gutting billions in US foreign assistance.</p><p>The problem is not that the United States is being ripped off by foreign countries and immigrants,&nbsp;as Trump contends. Instead, the US government should look to funding public services and regulating companies so that everyone has a&nbsp;living wage,&nbsp;access to health care, and adequate&nbsp;housing.  That may entail sweeping economic changes, but not those that the Trump administration has put into motion. What is needed is a human rights economy.</p>

The Tunisian government has turned arbitrary detention into a cornerstone of its repressive policy, aimed at depriving people of their civil and political rights.Following President Kais Saied’s takeover of Tunisia’s state institutions on July 25, 2021, the authorities have dramatically intensified their repression of dissent.Tunisian authorities should immediately release all those arbitrarily detained and stop prosecuting people for exercising their human rights. Tunisia’s international partners should urge the government to end its crackdown.<p>(Beirut) – The&nbsp;Tunisian government has turned arbitrary detention into a cornerstone of its repressive policy, aimed at depriving people of their civil and political rights, Human Rights Watch said in a report published today. The authorities should end their crackdown against perceived critics and release all those arbitrary detained, in many cases merely for exercising their human rights.&nbsp;</p><p>The 42-page report, “‘All Conspirators’: How Tunisia Uses Arbitrary Detention to Crush Dissent,” documents the government’s increased reliance on arbitrary detention and politically motivated prosecutions to intimidate, punish, and silence its critics. Human Rights Watch documented the cases of 22 people detained on abusive charges, including terrorism, in connection with their public statements or political activities. They include lawyers, political opponents, activists, journalists, social media users, and a human rights defender. At least 14 detainees could face capital punishment if convicted. Over 50 people were being held on political grounds or for exercising their rights as of January 2025.</p>

<p>“Not since the 2011 revolution have Tunisian authorities unleashed such repression,” said&nbsp;Bassam Khawaja, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “President Kais Saied's government has returned the country to an era of political prisoners, robbing Tunisians of hard-won civil liberties.”</p><p>Following President Saied’s&nbsp;takeover of Tunisia’s state institutions on July 25, 2021, the authorities have dramatically intensified their repression of dissent. Since early 2023, they have stepped up arbitrary arrests and detentions against people perceived as critical of the government, targeting opponents from across the political spectrum.&nbsp;</p><p>President Saied fuels security forces’ and judicial authorities’ targeting of dissent, Human Rights Watch found. He has often publicly accused government critics and unnamed political adversaries of being “traitors” and even “terrorists.”</p><p>Authorities have imprisoned Saied’s main political adversaries and prominent opposition figures, including Abir Moussi, president of the Free Destourian Party (PDL) and Rached Ghannouchi, former president of the Ennahda opposition party and former speaker of parliament. Prominent people detained for publicly criticizing the authorities include&nbsp;Sonia Dahmani, a lawyer, and Mohamed Boughalleb, a journalist.&nbsp;</p><p>The authorities have relied on an aggressive legal toolbox, including unfounded security and terrorism charges under the penal code and 2015&nbsp;Counterterrorism Law, which grants security forces broad monitoring and surveillance powers, allows for a suspect to be held up to 15 days in custody, and permits informants and witnesses to remain anonymous. The authorities have also used laws that breach freedom of expression and the right to privacy, including provisions of the penal code and Telecommunications Code as well as&nbsp;Decree-Law 54 on Cybercrime. They have charged many of the detainees whose cases were documented in this report with “attempting to change the nature of the state,” which can carry the death penalty.</p><p>Tunisian authorities have detained many critics for more than 14 months pretrial, the maximum permitted under Tunisian law. Judicial authorities have regularly brought additional charges or issued new detention orders to keep prominent figures behind bars, sometimes without even bringing detainees before a judge, Human Rights Watch found.&nbsp;</p><p>The authorities’ repeated&nbsp;attacks on the judiciary, including President Saied’s dismantling of the High Judicial Council, have severely undermined its independence and jeopardized Tunisians’ right to a fair trial. They have also&nbsp;targeted defense lawyers with judicial harassment, criminal prosecution, and travel bans for the legitimate exercise of their profession. Tunisian authorities have prosecuted, convicted, and detained civilians deemed critical of the authorities in military courts, which should not have jurisdiction over civilians.</p><p>Human Rights Watch found that detainees are often being held in harsh detention conditions and that authorities have failed to provide adequate medical care to several prisoners detained for their peaceful opinions or political activities. In some cases, they are subject to 24-hour video surveillance, round-the-clock artificial light, or strip searches.&nbsp;</p><p>Chadha Hadj Mbarek, a journalist who has a hearing disability and is serving five years for “attempting to change the nature of the state,” faces poor detention conditions and a lack of reasonable accommodation and support. She has difficulty hearing her family during visits due to the physical setup and has no communication support. Prison authorities have denied her access to her medication, her brother Amen told Human Rights Watch.&nbsp;</p><p>“She lost her livelihood, and being associated with a conspiracy and terrorism case made her feel like a pariah,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Tunisia is a state party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, which guarantee the right to freedom of expression and assembly, to a fair trial, and to not be subject to arbitrary arrest or detention.</p><p>Tunisian authorities should immediately release all those arbitrarily detained, drop abusive charges against them, and stop prosecuting individuals for exercising their human rights. Tunisia’s international partners should urge the government to end its crackdown and to protect space for freedom of expression, association, and assembly.</p><p>The European Union and its member states, which have largely failed to speak up regarding the dire human rights situation, should publicly express concerns about the deteriorating human rights situation in Tunisia and review any cooperation with Tunisia to ensure it is tied to compliance with international human rights obligations. The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights should urge Tunisia to immediately comply with the binding rulings of the African Court on Human and People's Rights.&nbsp;</p><p>“Tunisia’s international partners have consistently ignored the deteriorating human rights situation in Tunisia, even as political opponents and critics rack up one heavy-handed prison sentence after another,” Khawaja said. “The international community has an urgent responsibility to do its utmost to seek the release of all those unjustly detained.”</p>

<p>(Bishkek, April 16, 2025) – Kyrgyz authorities on April 14, 2025, detained a human rights defender, claiming she has ties to a criminal case, Human Rights Watch said today. The activist, Rita Karasartova, was detained for 48 hours in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, with a hearing about extending her detention set for April 16.&nbsp;</p><p>Karasartova posted on her personal Facebook page that the police may have been looking for her because she published a letter from Tilekmat Kurenov, a civil society activist who is feared forcibly disappeared by Kyrgyz authorities. A media report said the police claim Karasartova has “close ties” with the main suspects in a case, who are being charged with “fomenting of mass riots.”&nbsp;</p><p>“It seems that authorities detained Karasartova not based on evidence of criminal wrongdoing, but because she published a letter and is allegedly close to other suspects,” said Syinat Sultanalieva, Central Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch. “She should be freed immediately and no charges should be pursued against her.”</p><p>According to her daughter, approximately 12 police officers, 3 of them masked and armed, searched their home on April 14 without a search warrant, while Karasartova was not there. She was detained outside a shopping mall, where she was on personal business, as the search was ongoing at her home. She is currently being held at Chuy regional police headquarters, outside of Bishkek.</p><p>Kurenov, whose letter Karasartova posted, is a main target in a criminal investigation into opposition activists ongoing since January 2024, in which authorities are pursuing charges of calling for and preparing mass riots and attempting to seize power. Kurenov disappeared from Dubai on April 10 after Kyrgyz authorities spent months unsuccessfully seeking to extradite him from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Human Rights Watch has seen an interrogation protocol documenting the authorities’ questioning of Karasartova in detention that focuses entirely on her relationship with Kurenov and whether she supports his political opposition to the Kyrgyz government.&nbsp;</p><p>Karasartova published Kurenov’s letter that contained a message to his family on her personal Facebook page. Kurenov had asked that it be published in the event of his disappearance.&nbsp;</p><p>On April 9, the Kyrgyz State Committee on National Security (SCNS) made a public statement alleging that they had uncovered a plot to seize power, and that one of the alleged leaders was in the UAE. The committee said that the plotters intended to incite mass unrest on “ethno-nationalist grounds” to discredit the authorities.&nbsp;</p><p>Chuy district police also detained two other Kyrgyz citizens on April 14 whom they identified as “supporters of Kurenov” on suspicion of involvement in the alleged plot.&nbsp;</p><p>Karasartova is one of over 20 civil activists, bloggers, journalists, and human rights defenders whom Kyrgyz authorities detained en masse in October 2022 due to their public disagreement over the transfer of the Kempir-Abad dam to Uzbekistan. Karasartova spent eight months in pretrial detention before being released under house arrest. A Bishkek district court acquitted all Kempir-Abad detainees in June 2024, but the prosecution has appealed and the case is ongoing.&nbsp;</p><p>For the past year, Kyrgyz authorities have been systematically detaining and prosecuting journalists, bloggers, poets, and civil rights activists on charges of fomenting mass disorder or calling for mass riots. &nbsp;</p><p>Kyrgyzstan’s international partners should urge the Kyrgyz authorities to release Karasartova and not to pursue any charges against her. They should also urge the authorities to provide information on Kurenov’s whereabouts and to ensure that he is immediately brought before an independent judge and accorded his full due process rights, including access to a lawyer of his choosing and an independent medical exam.&nbsp;</p><p>During the first European Union-Central Asia Summit on April 4 and 5, as part of the agreements and pledges made there, Kyrgyzstan made commitments to respect freedom of expression and of association, to create an enabling environment for civil society and independent media, and to protect human rights defenders. It is critical that the EU now hold them to their commitments.&nbsp;</p><p>“Kyrgyz authorities should uphold their international human rights obligations and release Karasartova immediately,” Sultanalieva said. “Criticizing the authorities is not a call for mass disorder, but the exercise of a fundamental human right that Kyrgyz authorities need to respect and protect.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last week, the authorities in Tanzania arrested opposition presidential candidate Tundu Lissu on fabricated&nbsp;charges, then used his party’s calls for electoral reform to disqualify it from participating in upcoming elections. The government of President Samia Suluhu Hassan has previously repressed the political opposition and critical voices.&nbsp;</p><p>The authorities charged Lissu with treason and “publishing false information” online. They&nbsp;detained him for allegedly having “formed an intention” to instigate the public to obstruct the elections, based on his support for his party, Chama Cha Demokrasia na Maendeleo (Chadema), urging a boycott of the elections slated for late this year. Chadema has been calling for the government to undertake “fundamental electoral reforms” as part of&nbsp;its campaign, “No Reforms, No Elections.”</p><p>Treason in Tanzania carries a potential sentence of death and people charged with this offense are not eligible for bail.&nbsp;</p><p>On April 12, 2025, Tanzania’s electoral body, the Independent National Elections Commission,&nbsp;disqualified Chadema from participating in the elections after party officials refused to sign the 2025 Election Code of Ethics. Chadema had&nbsp;said it would not sign the code until the government undertook electoral reforms. Gaston Garubindi, Chadema’s legal and human rights director, told Human Rights Watch that he believes the government was deliberately targeting Lissu to derail the party’s reform campaign.</p><p>Successive Tanzanian governments have repressed the political opposition in previous elections. Prior to the 2020 elections, the government of the late President John Magufuli&nbsp;arbitrarily arrested scores of opposition party leaders, officials, and supporters, including Lissu. It also suspended media outlets, censored mobile phone communications, and blocked social media.</p><p>Ahead of the November 2024 local elections, the government of President Suluhu, who took office after Magufuli’s death in 2021, arbitrarily arrested hundreds of Chadema supporters, imposed restrictions on social media access, and banned independent media. The authorities were&nbsp;implicated in the abduction and extrajudicial killing of at least eight government critics. Chadema&nbsp;said thousands of its candidates were disqualified from participating.</p><p>The situation looks similarly troubling for this year’s elections.</p><p>Concerned governments should be pressing President Suluhu to reverse these repressive actions and ensure that basic rights and freedoms are respected in Tanzania so that the population is able to have the free and fair election to which they are entitled.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The April 9 coalition&nbsp;agreement between Germany’s Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union and Social Democratic Party is unfortunately a return to a harsh social security system packaged as “reform” and “simplification.” Rather than addressing the growing number of people in the country at risk of poverty, the agreement strips back support for people receiving long-term unemployment assistance and punishes them by withholding benefits for “failure to cooperate.”</p><p>Human Rights Watch recently&nbsp;documented how social security support in Germany already falls short of what is needed to protect people’s rights to social security and an adequate standard of living, and likely also fails to meet the “minimum subsistence level” (Existenzminimum) required under German constitutional law. Women in particular, including single parents and older women living alone, are foregoing everyday essentials such as food or heating.</p><p>The agreement replaces the “Citizen’s Income,” introduced only in 2023, with the “New Basic Income for Jobseekers,” that relies on an older annual inflation-indexing method to calculate social security entitlements, which will result in real-terms cuts to benefits. The indexing method will also apply to other “basic” social security support for people over 65 or people considered permanently unable to work. This stark reality belies the coalition agreement’s stated aim “to maintain the level of social protection.”</p><p>Heike, from Cologne, who receives basic social security support because the state considers her permanently unable to work due to a health condition, told us: “One of the things that scares me the most is how social benefits will go back to the old calculation for inflation. When the adjustments are finally made, we will continue to vegetate below the Existenzminimum.”</p><p>The coalition plans some positive measures, including improving pension care credits for mothers of young children and improving tax relief for single parents and older people who continue working beyond state pension eligibility age. It also pledges increasing the basic pension supplement for older people on low incomes and adding €5 per month to existing educational support for qualifying families on low incomes.</p><p>But these proposed measures will be undermined by the increase in poverty that flows from tightening “basic” forms of social security support, which is the clear priority of the incoming government.</p><p>Rather than taking this punitive, restrictive path, Germany’s new government should commit to genuine reform, starting with examining the adequacy of social security support and reviewing its Existenzminimum&nbsp;calculation method, to ensure everyone in the country can enjoy their right to a decent living standard.</p>

<p>(Brussels) – The&nbsp;European Union should press&nbsp;Bhutanese authorities to release dozens of political prisoners held for decades in dire conditions, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said today. An EU human rights dialogue with Bhutan is scheduled later this month, just weeks after United Nations human rights experts issued a communication raising concerns over reports that the prisoners were “denied due process and fair trials, including access to lawyers,” and allegedly subjected to torture.</p><p>The&nbsp;communication by six UN human rights experts, published on April 4, raises concerns that “the broad and vague definitions [of “treason”], combined with the severity of the punishments, have a severe chilling effect on the enjoyment of human rights … and consequently on democratic life and civic space in the country.”</p><p>“Bhutan portrays itself as a land of ‘mindfulness’ and ‘gross national happiness,’ but UN reports paint quite a different picture,” said Smriti Singh, Regional Director for South Asia at Amnesty International. “Dozens are still detained, mistreated, and tortured solely for peacefully dissenting against the government’s policy, an ordeal Bhutan’s King could end at the stroke of a pen.”</p><p>Bhutan is seeking to enhance its international partnerships and economic cooperation, including with Australia, India, Thailand, and the EU. The relationship with the EU includes tariff and quota-free access for Bhutanese exports to the EU market under the Everything but Arms scheme, which is linked to international human rights obligations.</p><p>The EU is also providing assistance intended to promote human rights and civil society space, as well as investment in infrastructure development. The EU should insist that Bhutan shows its commitment and respect for human rights by immediately releasing all 32 political prisoners and others detained solely for the peaceful exercise of their human rights, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch said. On April 14, Members of the European Parliament holding key positions on EU political and trade relations with Bhutan formulated similar calls in a letter to Bhutan’s prime minister.</p><p>The UN experts’ communication examines the cases of 19 named individuals, “among others,” expressing serious concern that their fair trial rights appear to have been violated, that they were “severely tortured, both to extract confessions and to punish them,” then convicted under “vague” laws, and jailed in inhumane conditions.</p><p>In 2023, Human Rights Watch documented the cases of 37 political prisoners in Bhutan. Since then, 5 have completed their sentences, leaving at least 32 still serving terms of between 32 years and life without parole.</p><p>In November 2024, another group of UN experts, the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, adopted an&nbsp;opinion on three of the prisoners’ cases, finding that they met the definition of arbitrary detention, which would make their detention illegal under international human rights law. Both groups of experts asked the Bhutan government to respond to the allegations but have received no response.</p><p>Most of the cases relate to events in or&nbsp;around 1990, when about 90,000 Nepali-speaking Bhutanese were expelled from Bhutan amid widespread rights violations and became refugees in Nepal. Those who remained in or returned to Bhutan, who publicly opposed the arbitrary citizenship determination, were arrested, tortured, and convicted in unfair trials based on coerced confessions. The longest serving political prisoners have been in jail since 1990, while others were arrested in 2008 after they re-entered Bhutan to campaign for the right to return.</p><p>Tens of thousands of Bhutanese refugees eventually received refugee resettlement in third countries, including in the United States. However, the Trump administration has deported close to a dozen of these resettled refugees, stating that they have been accused or convicted of crimes in the US. This is a clear violation of international human rights law, including customary international law and the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which prohibits the transfer of any person to another state where the individual could be at risk of being subjected to torture.</p><p>The Bhutan government permitted the US government to deport them to Bhutan and then promptly expelled them to Nepal via India, suggesting that the Bhutanese authorities continue to discriminate against this community.</p><p>The new UN communication raises allegations that “[p]olitical prisoners are reportedly given inadequate food, water, heating, bedding and warm clothing” and that “detainees [also] suffer shortages of medicines and access to doctors. Those with physical illnesses – some as a result of alleged torture – do not receive necessary medical treatment, which may have contributed to the death of two detainees.” The detainees are prevented from communicating with their families, they said.</p><p>The UN experts noted that in 1999 the former King Jigme Singye Wangchuck granted amnesty to 40 political prisoners, including some serving life sentences.&nbsp;<br />In 2022, the present king granted amnesty to a political prisoner serving a life term. “We implore the King to exercise His Majesty’s power to pardon and release from prison the remaining political prisoners, so as to demonstrate Bhutan’s commitment to upholding human rights and its international legal obligations,” the UN experts wrote.</p><p>“Bhutan has adopted significant reforms since 2008, but the continued detention of political prisoners represents a major stain on its human rights record,” said&nbsp;Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Bhutan’s international partners and investors, including the EU, should make it clear that they expect Bhutan to comply with its human rights obligations and release them without further delay.”</p>

The organization, which interviewed local community members for its&nbsp;new report on plastics, calls on California to legislate a US$5 billion plastic mitigation fund, paid for in part by polluters, to support the communities most impacted by plastics.</p><p>Plastics are mostly made of fossil fuels, and the new report echoes Human Rights Watch&nbsp;concerns that Black and Brown communities are often hardest hit with health and other harmful impacts from the fossil fuel industry due to the extraction, manufacturing, use of, and disposal of fossil fuel products. Plastics&nbsp;pose significant threats to human health, including reproductive health, and contribute to the climate crisis.</p><p>People told&nbsp;Black Women for Wellness that they feel overwhelmed by the unavoidability of exposure to plastics. This is especially the case when families rely on plastic-wrapped, low-cost food and drinks. They also noted how hard it is to find clear information on the health risks of chemicals contained in plastics and how to protect themselves from exposure to these chemicals.&nbsp;</p><p>Southern Los Angeles, the focus of the report, has long endured fossil fuel pollution, specifically from oil drilling and extraction. The community is both densely populated and the site of a massive oil field with thousands of active and idle wells that emit hazardous gases. Many years of advocacy was needed to obtain recent&nbsp;promises to reduce&nbsp;drilling and cap idle wells.&nbsp;</p><p>Black Women for Wellness fights racism and environmental harms to women’s and reproductive health, issues that are deeply interconnected. As the report notes, “chemicals released during the lifecycle of plastic are endocrine disrupting chemicals, which are linked to reproductive harms and infertility.” More work like this is needed to highlight and warn of the links between myriad forms of fossil fuel industry pollution and adverse maternal and newborn health outcomes, such as preterm birth and low birth weight.&nbsp;</p><p>US President Donald J. Trump’s administration has already begun to&nbsp;roll back environmental regulations, which could profoundly harm maternal and reproductive health. This makes the group’s recommendations to the state of California, including increasing public education about the plastic lifecycle, better regulating the fossil fuel industry, and helping communities access more sustainable options, all the more important.</p>

<p>(Beirut) –&nbsp;Lebanese journalists, media organizations, and civil society groups are facing the repeated use of criminal defamation charges and other vague legal provisions in response to their work alleging corruption and financial mismanagement in the country, Human Rights Watch said today. On April 10, Lebanon’s public prosecution summoned journalists from&nbsp;Daraj and&nbsp;Megaphone, two Lebanese media organizations, and the executive director of&nbsp;Kulluna Irada, an advocacy group, for investigative hearings on April 15. Security services previously summoned Daraj journalists in March for questioning.<br /><br />“Lebanon’s recent political changes have not deterred authorities form clamping down on independent media and civil society organizations investigating and reporting on alleged financial misconduct and corruption,” said&nbsp;Adam Coogle, deputy Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. “Once again, we are witnessing the weaponization of criminal defamation laws and other dubious legal provisions in order to stifle attempts to shed light on years of financial malpractices.”</p><p>Lebanon’s new president and government, including the minister of information, as well as the current parliament should publicly commit to protecting the right to freedom of expression.<br /><br />Since March 2025, Lebanon’s Anti-Cybercrime and Intellectual Property Rights Bureau, an Internal Security Forces unit tasked with combating cybercrime and enhancing online security, has twice summoned the editor-in-chief of&nbsp;Daraj following&nbsp;lawsuits over its investigations. Daraj’s lawyer told Human Rights Watch that documents he reviewed related to the lawsuits stated they were filed by Antoun Sehnaoui, the CEO of Lebanese bank Société Générale de Banque au Liban (SGBL). The lawsuits, which accuse Daraj of “defamation” and other vague charges, were filed following the media organization’s reporting on alleged financial malpractices by SGBL and the Lebanese banking sector more generally.</p><p>Media reports and Daraj’s lawyer say that Sehnaoui first&nbsp;filed a libel and defamation lawsuit against Daraj’s editor-in-chief, Hazem al-Amin, and journalist Jana Barakat in March 2024 in response to a 2023 investigative report on alleged financial malpractices by SGBL and Sehnaoui in the years leading up to and following Lebanon’s economic and financial crisis in 2019. Sehnaoui filed a second lawsuit against al-Amin, the lawyer said, on March 10, 2025, in relation to a video report commenting on Sehanoui’s initial lawsuit and al-Amin’s summons by the cybercrime bureau. Human Rights Watch sent a&nbsp;letter outlining its findings and posing questions to Antoun Sehnaoui on April 4 but has not received a response.</p><p>A third&nbsp;complaint, filed by three lawyers in March, accuses Daraj and Megaphone of “undermining the state’s financial standing and destabilizing confidence in the Lebanese currency and bonds,” “inciting depositors to withdraw their funds,” “stirring up strife,” “undermining the prestige of the state and national sentiment,” “assault and conspiracy against state security,” and “receiving foreign funding for media campaigns seeking to harm Lebanon.” On March 26, Lebanon’s top public prosecutor&nbsp;referred this complaint to the public prosecutor at the court of appeals.<br /><br />On March 11, a separate group of lawyers filed a complaint against the Lebanese advocacy group Kulluna Irada, accusing the group of publishing false or exaggerated information “that seeks to weaken the morale of the nation,” “undermine the prestige of the state or its financial standing,” and “to cause a decline in the value of national banknotes or undermine confidence in the strength of the state’s currency, its bonds, and all other securities related to public financial confidence.” On March 25, Lebanese TV reported that Lebanon’s public prosecutor also had referred the complaint to the public prosecutor at the court of appeals.</p><p>Human Rights Watch has previously&nbsp;documented the Lebanese authorities’ increasing use of defamation and insult laws to silence journalists, activists, and others critical of government policies and corruption. Even if the judiciary is quick to dismiss such complaints, they are an intimidation tactic that can have a chilling effect on the media and lead to self-censorship, Human Rights Watch said.<br /><br />As parliament debates a new media law, it should affirm Lebanon’s human rights obligations by repealing insult and defamation provisions in the penal code and replacing them with civil penalties. Parliament should ensure that the new media law meets international human rights standards, including by eliminating all charges and penalties based on peaceful speech, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>In a 2019 report, Human Rights Watch&nbsp;found that the Cybercrimes Bureau had initiated 3,599 defamation investigations between January 2015 and May 2019. The numbers the bureau provided to Human Rights Watch at the time indicated a 325 percent increase in defamation cases for online speech between 2015 and 2018, coinciding with worsening economic conditions and public disillusionment in Lebanon.<br /><br />In a&nbsp;joint statement in March, Lebanese media organizations, civil society groups, and parliament members condemned the ongoing campaign to silence media outlets and called on Lebanon’s Public Prosecution Offices to reject politically motivated investigations of journalists and civil society organizations.</p><p>Lebanon’s constitution guarantees freedom of expression “within the limits established by law,” but the penal code criminalizes defamation against public officials and authorizes imprisonment for up to one year.</p><p>“Without serious reforms, criminal defamation laws in Lebanon are easily exploited to stifle legitimate speech,” Coogle said. “As Lebanon’s government promises key financial, judicial, and social reforms, it should also work to strengthen freedom of expression protections afforded under Lebanese law.”</p>

<p>(Geneva, April 14, 2025)&nbsp;– The United Nations Human Rights Council’s first resolution on landmines strongly endorses the long-standing international treaty prohibiting antipersonnel mines at a critical time, Human Rights Watch said today. The council Resolution 58/22 on “the impact of anti-personnel mines on the full enjoyment of all human rights” was adopted without a vote on April 4, 2025, the International Day for Mine Action and Mine Awareness.</p><p>Since March, five European countries have announced their intention to withdraw from the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, while US government aid cuts have disrupted mine clearance operations around the world, putting civilian lives at risk.&nbsp;</p><p>“The UN Human Rights Council resolution on antipersonnel landmines, supported by countries from around the world, sends a clear message that these weapons violate fundamental human rights,” said Mary Wareham, deputy crisis, conflict and arms director at Human Rights Watch. “Countries contemplating leaving the Mine Ban Treaty should reconsider given the devastating, long-term risk posed to civilians and the global support for the ban.”</p><p>The resolution directs the UN high commissioner for human rights to report on the impact of antipersonnel mines “on the enjoyment of all human rights, with particular emphasis on economic, social and cultural rights.” It sets up an interactive dialogue on landmines at the council’s 62nd session in the first half of 2026.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Antipersonnel mines are designed to explode in response to a person’s presence, proximity, or contact. They are typically placed by hand, but can also be scattered by aircraft, rockets, and artillery or dispersed from drones and specialized vehicles. They cannot distinguish between soldiers and civilians, making them unlawfully indiscriminate under international humanitarian law.&nbsp;</p><p>Uncleared landmines pose a danger until cleared and destroyed. Mined land can drive displacement of the civilian population, hinder the delivery of humanitarian aid, and prevent agricultural activities. A Human Rights Watch report published on April 8, 2025, says that contamination from landmines, cluster munitions, and other weapons used during the 14-year conflict in Syria has killed at least 249 people, including 60 children, and injured another 379 since December 8, 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>The Landmine Monitor in its 2024 report found that civilians made up 84 percent of all recorded landmine casualties in 2023, while children were 37 percent of casualties when the age was recorded. The highest number of casualties in 2023 was recorded in Myanmar, where antipersonnel mines have been used by junta forces and opposition, and ethnic armed groups in all 14 Myanmar states and regions, affecting about 60 percent of the country’s townships.</p><p>A group of countries from all regions, including Algeria, Croatia, Mozambique, Peru, South Africa, United Kingdom, and Vanuatu, submitted the resolution to the council. The resolution notes the positive efforts of countries, international organizations, and civil society to address the humanitarian impacts of antipersonnel mines through implementation of the Mine Ban Treaty, also called the Ottawa Convention. It urges all countries to accede to the treaty and “strengthen their efforts to put an end to the suffering and casualties caused by antipersonnel mines.”</p><p>The Mine Ban Treaty, ratified by 165 countries, prohibits use, production, transfer, and stockpiling of antipersonnel mines and requires parties to destroy stockpiles, clear mined areas, and assist victims. Russia has not joined the treaty and its forces have used antipersonnel landmines extensively in Ukraine since its full-scale invasion in 2022, causing civilian casualties and contaminating agricultural land. Mine Ban Treaty member state Ukraine has also used antipersonnel mines since 2022 and has received them from the United States, in violation of the treaty.</p><p>Russia’s war in Ukraine and uncertainty over Europe’s future security are contributing to a difficult environment as five European Union member states are considering leaving the treaty. On March 18, defense ministers from Poland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania announced&nbsp;their governments’ intent to withdraw from the treaty. On April 1, Prime Minister Petteri Orpo of Finland announced that his government is preparing to withdraw from the treaty to “give us the possibility to prepare for the changes in the security environment in a more versatile way.”&nbsp;</p><p>Withdrawal from the Mine Ban Treaty typically requires formal parliamentary approval by the state party concerned. Article 20 of the treaty explicitly prevents a state party that is engaged in armed conflict from withdrawing before the end of the conflict. Any withdrawal will take effect six months after the denunciation documents are submitted to the UN and the convention’s states parties as long as the country is not engaged in armed conflict at that time.</p><p>For over three decades, the United States has been the world’s largest contributor to humanitarian demining, mine risk education, and rehabilitation programs for landmine survivors. But the Trump administration’s deep cuts to foreign aid are now disrupting mine clearance operations. Thousands of deminers have been fired or put on administrative leave pending the completion of ostensible reviews.&nbsp;</p><p>Of the 47 current members of the council, 40 have ratified the Mine Ban Treaty. China, Cuba, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Morocco, South Korea, and Vietnam have not.</p><p>The council resolution says that all states and other relevant stakeholders should cooperate to accelerate demining efforts and ensure inclusive, non-discriminatory, and comprehensive victim assistance. It also urges “coordinated, multi-sectoral efforts” so that the needs of landmine survivors—in particular children, their families and communities—are effectively addressed and “their human rights promoted and protected.”</p><p>“Statements by European countries looking to withdraw from the Mine Ban Treaty ignore the reasons they joined the treaty in the first place,” Wareham said. “They should remind themselves why antipersonnel mines have been thoroughly stigmatized for decades and not seek a return of this ghastly weapon.”</p><p>Human Rights Watch is a co-founder of the&nbsp;International Campaign to Ban Landmines, which received the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize, and the Cluster Munition Coalition. It contributes to the campaign’s annual Landmine and Cluster Munition Monitor reports.&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Brussels, April 14, 2025) – European Union High Representative Kaja Kallas and EU foreign ministers should focus on the protection of Palestinians’ rights during the high-level dialogue with the Palestinian Authority (PA) on April 14, 2025, Human Rights Watch said today.</p><p>In recent months, the PA has escalated its repression of dissent, arbitrarily arresting and torturing critics and opponents with impunity. Following the February 24 EU-Israel Association Council meeting, Israeli authorities have ratcheted up their repression of Palestinians in the West Bank, part of their crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution, and are continuing to carry out acts of genocide in Gaza.</p><p>“Israeli authorities’ atrocities do not give the Palestinian Authority a free pass to arrest and torture critics and opponents.” said Claudio Francavilla, associate EU director at Human Rights Watch. “The EU should denounce the Palestinian Authority’s abuses, but it won’t be taken seriously unless it ends its own double standards and addresses Israel’s apartheid and acts of genocide against the Palestinians.”</p><p>As the main donor to the PA, the EU should press to end arbitrary arrests, mistreatment, and torture. Palestinian security forces arbitrarily arrest critics and opponents and taunt, mistreat, beat, and torture detainees with impunity, as Human Rights Watch has extensively documented.</p><p>Hamza Zbeidat, 40, told Human Rights Watch that PA police forces arrested him from his home in the Dheisheh refugee camp near Bethlehem on February 20, hours after he called on Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to step down in a Facebook post. He said that PA forces “hit me nonstop across my body, cursed at me and yelled, ‘you dog, you animal, we will educate you.’” They placed him in an overcrowded cell and dumped cold water on him on a frigid day, he said. Interrogators questioned him about the post and prosecutors charged him with insulting “higher authorities,” under their restrictive cybercrime law, as well as with assault of an officer during his arrest, court documents show. The PA routinely uses the charge of insulting “higher authorities,” as they also did following a 2021 arrest of Zbeidat for participating in a protest over the killing of a prominent activist by PA forces, and related charges to criminalize peaceful dissent. They released him on February 28, but the charge remains outstanding.</p><p>In 2024, the Palestinian statutory watchdog, the Independent Commission for Human Rights, received 231 complaints for arbitrary arrests, including detention without trial or charge, and 124 complaints of torture and ill-treatment during detention by the PA. In an April 2024 report, the commission said it received 1,148 complaints about torture and ill-treatment against the PA, 766 against the police, between 2018 and 2022 and highlighted widespread impunity for these abuses.</p><p>Human Rights Watch wrote to PA Prime Minister Mohammed Mustafa on February 27 to request updated information about arrests and treatment of detainees but has not received a substantive response.</p><p>Between December 5 and January 21, the PA conducted security operations in the Jenin refugee camp in which at least 11 people were killed in December alone. Those killed included security officers, but also at least two children, a journalism student, and an unarmed resident riding a motorcycle, the commission reported. Seven camp residents told Human Rights Watch that amid these operations they often could not safely enter and leave the camp, access to food, electricity, and water was limited, and many homes were damaged. The Palestinian legal organization Lawyers for Justice documented over 200 arrests and abuses, including arbitrary detention, restrictions on access to lawyers, and communication with family, and torture.</p><p>On January 21, the Israeli army raided the Jenin refugee camp, which they have controlled since, and displaced more than 16,000 residents, destroyed critical infrastructure, and killed 25 Palestinians.</p><p>Amid Al Jazeera’s reporting on the PA operations in Jenin, the Palestinian attorney general on January 1 suspended the international media outlet from broadcasting from the occupied territory, following a ministerial committee’s assessment that it had broadcast “inciting” material and “misinformation, sedition and interference in Palestinian internal affairs.”</p><p>On January 5, a Palestinian court restricted local access to several Al Jazeera websites, claiming that their reporting “threaten[s] national security and incite[s] the commission of crimes.” The Israeli government has also banned Al Jazeera and closed its Ramallah office. The bans on Al Jazeera are an alarming escalation by Israeli and Palestinian authorities to restrict media freedom and further limit the spread of information about serious abuses in Israel and Palestine, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>In January, the Palestinian Human Rights Organizations Council wrote to President Abbas about the “numerous violations” they had documented by Palestinian security forces, including “torture, ill-treatment, violations of freedom of opinion and expression, arbitrary arrests and detentions as punitive measures, collective punishments, including holding citizens as hostages, the closure of newspapers, media outlets, and websites … issuance of administrative decisions aimed at intimidating citizens, and failure to respect and implement judicial decisions.”</p><p>In March, the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights documented a “pattern of arbitrary detention and torture and ill-treatment of detainees, including perceived opponents in the West Bank … journalists, human rights defenders and other individuals deemed to be critical” by the PA.” It highlighted accounts by men and boys of “severe beatings” and “prolonged placement in stress positions, threats, and solitary confinement.”</p><p>During the EU-Israel Association Council meeting with Israel’s Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar on February 24, EU foreign ministers raised concerns about Israeli abuses against Palestinians, but their calls went unanswered. Israeli authorities again blocked all aid from entering Gaza, in flagrant violation of international law and a genocidal act, and launched renewed airstrikes that have killed hundreds of civilians, including women and children, journalists, and paramedics. In the northern West Bank, Israel is increasingly using abusive tactics from Gaza in an escalating campaign.</p><p>In July 2024, a groundbreaking ruling by the International Court of Justice found that Israel’s occupation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory is unlawful and that Israel is responsible for racial segregation and apartheid – adding to the consensus within the human rights movement. The court stated that Israeli settlements should be dismantled and that no other country – including the EU and its member states – should recognize or support Israel’s occupation, including trading with or investing in the settlements.</p><p>In February, 163 organizations and trade unions, including Human Rights Watch, urged the EU to ban trade and business with the settlements. They have yet to receive a reply, and requests for meetings with EU leaders to discuss the matter have been dismissed.</p><p>Given Israel’s atrocities in Gaza, the governments of Spain and Ireland, numerous organizations, including Human Rights Watch, and Members of the European Parliament have urged the EU to review, with a view to suspend, the EU-Israel Association Agreement. Other calls supported by Human Rights Watch and other groups include suspending arms transfers to Israel, given the high risk of complicity in serious crimes, and support for the International Criminal Court and execution of all its arrest warrants. EU member states, though, are sharply divided and the EU Commission is reluctant to hold Israeli authorities to account.</p><p>“Palestinians find themselves between a rock and a hard place, and the EU is supporting both repressive authorities,” Francavilla said. “If the EU really cares about the human rights of Palestinians, it should take long overdue action to hold Israeli authorities to account and stop financing the PA’s machinery of repression.”</p>

<p>(Brussels, April 14, 2025) – Frontex, the&nbsp;European Union’s Border and Coast Guard agency, should ensure that its aerial surveillance capacity is used to save lives at sea, Human Rights Watch said today. The organization met with Frontex Executive Director Hans Leijtens on April 2, 2025, to deliver an EU-wide petition calling on the agency to take concrete steps that would enable more timely rescues of vessels in distress.</p><p>“The shocking death toll in the Mediterranean requires concerted action,” said&nbsp;Judith Sunderland, associate Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “As an actor at sea, Frontex has a responsibility under international law to use its resources to facilitate rescues that end in disembarkation of rescued people in a safe place.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the last decade, at least&nbsp;31,700 people have died or been reported missing in the Mediterranean Sea, according to the International Organization for Migration. More than three-fourths of these deaths and disappearances occur in the Central Mediterranean, between North Africa and Italy/Malta, making it by far the deadliest stretch.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;petition calls on Frontex to take clear steps to uphold its EU and international human rights obligations by prioritizing saving lives at sea. The agency should ensure that information about boats in distress sighted by Frontex aircraft is shared with nongovernmental rescue ships in the area. It should issue more frequent emergency alerts that go to all vessels and provide continuous monitoring as much as possible of vessels in distress.&nbsp;</p><p>Frontex should address any current constraints on its ability to take these steps, Human Rights Watch said. This includes ensuring it can operate on a broad interpretation of distress that reflects the foreseeable danger facing unseaworthy boats at sea and the positive obligations attached to the right to life.&nbsp;</p><p>In December 2024, a group of United Nations agencies, along with the Centre for Humanitarian Action at Sea,&nbsp;called jointly for a “broad understanding of distress,” resulting in a humanitarian and precautionary approach to identifying and responding to distress situations.”&nbsp;</p><p>The European Commission has signaled its intention to&nbsp;significantly expand Frontex by tripling its standing corps to 30,000 border guards and to&nbsp;review its mandate in 2026 to increase its role in deportations. Frontex’s size, role, and responsibilities have grown significantly since it was created in 2004. The agency’s mandate was significantly expanded already in 2019 when a revised regulation expanded its tasks and empowered it to have a standing corps of 10,000 border guards. Frontex’s annual budget skyrocketed from €142 million in 2015 to €922 million in 2024.</p><p>Any changes to Frontex’s mandate should strengthen rather than dilute its human rights standards, transparency, and accountability, Human Rights Watch said. This would include making sure that providing Frontex assets and services to member states is conditional on a broad definition of distress, cooperation with humanitarian organizations, and monitoring of distress cases and rescue operations. &nbsp;</p><p>The petition delivered to Frontex is part of the Human Rights Watch&nbsp;#WithHumanity campaign.  Almost 18,000 people signed the petition, with almost half of all signatures coming from Italy, which is on the front lines of rescue-at-sea efforts, with the remaining signatures primarily from France, Germany, Spain, and Sweden. Twenty-two nongovernmental organizations supported the initiative. The overall engagement with the campaign reflects strong support for measures to address the appalling loss of life in the Mediterranean Sea, Human Rights Watch said.&nbsp;</p><p>A 2022&nbsp;analysis by Human Rights Watch and Border Forensics of Frontex aerial surveillance concluded that the agency’s practices make it complicit in well-documented abusive and indefinite arbitrary detention and other serious human rights violations in Libya.</p><p>While largely&nbsp;abdicating responsibility for search-and-rescue operations since 2017, the EU and its member states have focused on shoring up the ability of countries on the southern rim of the Mediterranean Sea to patrol their coastlines. Aerial surveillance by Frontex in the Central Mediterranean is part of this strategy: the agency shares the location of migrant boats it spots with relevant EU member states but also with authorities in Libya and Tunisia. This enables interdictions followed by returns to those countries, where migrants face serious human rights abuses.&nbsp;</p><p>As an EU agency, Frontex has human rights obligations under the&nbsp;EU Charter of Fundamental Rights as well as under the 2019 Frontex Regulation and the agency’s own Fundamental Rights Action Plan. International human rights law obliges Frontex to refrain from violating anyone’s human rights directly and not to expose them indirectly to serious violations of those rights, such as torture, elsewhere. The agency should therefore take steps to mitigate the human rights risks of its intelligence-gathering and border management activities. Frontex is also bound to protect the right to life, including by&nbsp;taking positive steps to prevent loss of life where there are foreseeable threats and life-threatening situations.&nbsp;</p><p>“People across the EU are sending a message that no one should be left to die at sea,” Sunderland said. “As warmer weather may see more attempts to cross the Mediterranean, Frontex should act now to ensure it does everything it can to prevent avoidable tragedies.”</p>

<p>(Nairobi) – Leaders gathering in London on April 15, 2025, should urgently work to protect civilians and guarantee safe, unfettered aid provision as the conflict in&nbsp;Sudan enters its third year, Human Rights Watch said today. The conference, co-hosted by the United Kingdom, the European Union, France, and Germany, takes place as civilians across Sudan continue to&nbsp;face egregious abuses and deliberate harm.&nbsp;</p><p>The Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) have committed widespread abuses, including extrajudicial killings, sexual violence, and rampant looting, and destruction of civilian infrastructure since conflict broke out on April 15, 2023. The RSF and allied militias have committed war crimes and crimes against humanity in a campaign of ethnic cleansing in West Darfur. Tens of thousands of people have been killed and more injured. An estimated 12.9 million people have fled their homes; half the country’s population faces acute hunger, and famine is spreading.</p><p>“For the last two years, Sudan’s warring parties have subjected the population to horrific abuses and suffering, and blocked aid, plunging the country into the world’s worst humanitarian disasters,” said&nbsp;Mohamed Osman, Sudan researcher at Human Rights Watch. “International leaders should ensure that discussions to improve the humanitarian situation go hand in hand with commitments at the highest level to protect civilians.”</p>

<p>The UK, as co-host of the conference, should build on past efforts at the United Nations Security Council to advance the discussion on civilian protection. They should ensure that like-minded countries, including from Africa and Middle East, make concrete commitments to protect civilians such as by forming a coalition of countries dedicated to moving this agenda forward and considering options such as the deployment of a mission to protect civilians, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>Participants should also publicly acknowledge the lifesaving role of local responders and health workers, commit to provide them with support and protection, and make it clear that war crimes like attacks on medical facilities and personnel will have consequences.</p><p>In recent weeks, the SAF has regained control over areas previously under RSF control. On March 27, 2025, Lt. Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, SAF’s commander,&nbsp;announced his forces had pushed the RSF out of the capital, Khartoum, which had been largely under RSF control since the conflict’s onset. On March 20, the&nbsp;UN reported that dozens of civilians including local humanitarian workers had been killed in shelling and bombings, and that the RSF had summarily executed people in their homes, while forces from both sides had looted civilian property and aid supplies.</p><p>Three volunteers in Khartoum told Human Rights Watch that in the months before the SAF drove the RSF out of Khartoum, the RSF targeted community kitchens in areas under their control, detaining several volunteers, looting food supplies, and imposing so called “protection fees.” The SAF has also intimidated, and arrested volunteers in areas under their&nbsp;control.&nbsp;</p><p>On April 3, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk&nbsp;condemned reports of “widespread extrajudicial killings of civilians in Khartoum following its recapture by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) on 26 March.”</p><p>As displaced people start returning to Khartoum, images are emerging confirming massive destruction of civilian infrastructure and looting of property. International media outlets&nbsp;reported the discovery of an RSF detention center and up to 550 new graves, and former detainees spoke of torture and starvation at the site.&nbsp;</p><p>“We came back to Khartoum to find it in ruins,” a 51-year-old woman who returned home to Bahri, Khartoum’s sister city, told Human Rights Watch. “In our neighborhood, everyone lost a relative or neighbor because of the fighting. Some of our neighbors have been missing for months. We found out that people are using a playground nearby as a graveyard because they couldn’t bury their loved ones properly in the cemetery.”&nbsp;</p><p>Civilians are still under attack in areas where hostilities continue. For almost a year, incessant fighting in El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur, has killed countless civilians and forced many to flee to Zamzam, a camp for displaced people 15 kilometers away, where famine was first declared last August and which the RSF has repeatedly&nbsp;attacked in 2025. In January, an alleged drone&nbsp;strike on a hospital in El Fasher reportedly killed dozens of people. These attacks forced the UN World Food Programme to&nbsp;pause food distribution there in February. According to the UN, at least 70&nbsp;children have been reportedly killed or maimed in El Fasher in the last three months alone. Leaders meeting in London should press the warring parties in and around El Fasher to protect civilians, allow safe movement of people and aid in line with their international humanitarian law obligations and the Security Council resolution adopted in June 2024.</p><p>During the SAF offensive to recapture Gezira state, which was largely under RSF control between December 2023 and February 2025, SAF and allied militia&nbsp;attacked civilians in the capital city, Madani, and surrounding areas. Human Rights Watch&nbsp;found that the Sudan Shield, an armed group fighting alongside SAF, intentionally targeted civilians and their property in an attack on the village of Tayba on January 10, 2025, killing at least 26 people. The RSF, which has carried out widespread summary killings, rape, and looting in Gezira while the state was under its control, also reportedly continued to attack parts of the state,&nbsp;killing at least 18 people in March 2025.</p><p>Aerial bombardments by SAF continue, including an attack on a busy&nbsp;market in Tora, North Darfur, in March 2025 that reportedly killed and injured dozens of people.&nbsp;</p><p>Both sides are obstructing aid and continue to target local responders, while funding cuts to humanitarian aid, including those imposed by the Trump administration, have further undermined aid operations including the operating capacity of local responders. UN experts&nbsp;said in June 2024, that both parties are using starvation as a weapon of war. On March 14, 2025, the secretary general of the international medical charity MSF (Doctors Without Borders) told the Security Council that “violence against civilians is driving humanitarian needs.”&nbsp;</p><p>Impunity for the crimes in Sudan emboldens abusive forces, Human Rights Watch said. In February 2025, Türk said that “accountability, regardless of the rank and affiliation of the perpetrators, is critical to breaking the recurring cycle of violence and impunity in Sudan.”</p><p>Governments should also commit to closing the impunity gap, including by ensuring the necessary political and financial support for ongoing investigations, notably by the International Criminal Court, the UN Fact-Finding Mission, and the African Commission for Peoples’ and Human Rights, as well as pushing the warring parties to allow access to Sudan by independent monitors and investigators.</p><p>Another key factor fueling the violence and emboldening the warring parties is the undeterred flow of weapons from external actors. In September 2024, Human Rights Watch&nbsp;documented the use of apparently newly acquired foreign-made equipment in regions of Sudan including Darfur, where a UN arms embargo is still in effect.</p><p>Leaders meeting in London should condemn arms embargo violations, including by the UAE, and commit to expanding the UN arms embargo and sanctions regime and to preventing the sale of any arms that could end up in the hands of Sudan’s warring parties.&nbsp;</p><p>“Global leaders have a chance to take firmer action to stop the warring sides from carrying out atrocities against civilians and allow aid to flow to those in dire need,” Osman said. “Leaders should provide life-saving aid, provide financial and political backing to local responders, support accountability efforts, and support creation of a global mission to protect civilians.”</p>

<p>(New York) –&nbsp;China’s government has arrested dozens of people in Tibetan areas since 2021 for politically motived phone and internet-related offenses, Human Rights Watch said today. Tibetan journalists in exile report that these arrests typically target Tibetans accused of keeping “banned content” on their phone or contacting people outside China, including relatives.</p><p>The full scale of such arrests and prosecutions is unknown, as Chinese authorities do not disclose official data for political offenses. The more than 60 reported cases appear related to an increase in government surveillance during this period, including through mass phone searches and the use of mandatory phone apps with built-in government surveillance, as well as a tightened regulatory regime on data and religion.&nbsp;</p><p>“For Tibetans, simply using a cellphone has become dangerous, and everyday activities like posting a humorous video or contacting loved ones abroad can bring arrest, detention, and torture,” said&nbsp;Maya Wang, associate China director at Human Rights Watch. “Tibetans, particularly those living in remote areas, once celebrated the arrival of cellphones so they could stay in touch with friends and family, but their phones have effectively become government tracking devices.”</p><p>Human Rights Watch reviewed relevant cases since 2021 reported by Tibetan exile media, including Radio Free Asia and the Tibet Times, general media outlets, and official Chinese government sources. Human Rights Watch also interviewed residents in Tibetan areas, and a retired official with direct knowledge of the situation.</p><p>In many cases, those arrested were accused of keeping “banned content” on their phones or sharing it online. Such “banned content” typically includes references to Tibetan religious figures, particularly the exiled spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, and expressions of pro-Tibetan sentiment. Chinese authorities have applied the ambiguous language of the law broadly: in one case, a man was&nbsp;arrested for setting up a WeChat group celebrating the birthdays of 80-year-old Buddhist monks. The police said it was “illegal” to form such a chat group “without permission.”</p><p>Tibetans have also been arrested for posting content online that the police deem to be promoting the use of Tibetan language and opposing the Chinese government’s language policy in primary schools, which&nbsp;replaces Tibetan with Mandarin Chinese as the medium of instruction. The authorities have closed down several Tibetan-language websites hosting cultural and educational content since 2020, including the popular Luktsang Palyon blog in April 2024, the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy reported. A leading Tibetan webmaster, Bumpa Gyal, was&nbsp;sentenced to seven years in prison in 2022 for engaging in unspecified “illegal activities,” after he offered technical support to Tibetan cultural and education websites.</p><p>Chinese authorities have also arrested Tibetans for using their electronic devices to contact people outside China and for sharing information about Tibet abroad. Those arrested have been prosecuted and received lengthy prison sentences for such activities. In 2021, Human Rights Watch documented the arrest of four monks in southwest Tibet who were sentenced to up to 20 years in prison for contacting Tibetan monks of the same monastic order living in Nepal.&nbsp;</p><p>It is often unclear what happened to people who have been arrested, given the extreme information controls in the region. However, in the few cases where information was available, some of those arrested were imprisoned, mistreated, and tortured. In a particularly egregious case, a 38-year-old monk named Losel from Lhasa’s Sera Monastery was beaten and died from his injuries in May 2024. He had been arrested for allegedly “collecting and sending information abroad,” Tibetan exile media reported.&nbsp;</p><p>Many Tibetans have relatives living in exile in South Asia, Europe, and North America. The Chinese government’s&nbsp;intensified security measures following the 2008 Tibetan protests, which put an end to unauthorized border crossings and its discriminatory restrictions on the issuance of passports to Tibetans since 2012, have made foreign travel impossible for most Tibetans. The restrictions and monitoring of internet use and the punishment of users suspected of having contacts outside China mean that Tibetans in China and those in exile now have extremely limited contact.</p><p>Many of the Chinese government’s tactics against Tibetans to cut off their communication with the outside world are&nbsp;similar to those being used against Uyghurs, Human Rights Watch said.&nbsp;</p><p>The Chinese government should respect Tibetans’ rights to privacy and freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, association, and religion, Human Rights Watch said. The government should allow United Nations monitors, independent human rights researchers, and journalists unfettered access to the region to examine these cases and the general human rights situation.</p><p>“Tibetans have not only lost their rights to freely express themselves and to access information, but they are losing even their basic right to communicate with their loved ones,” Wang said. “Even as global communications grow, the Chinese government increasingly seeks to close off and control entire populations.”</p><p>Policing the Internet<br />The Chinese government’s monitoring of people’s online activity is not new. The Ministry of Public Security&nbsp;employs internet police personnel at provincial, prefecture, and county levels to censor and surveil internet users, while social media companies censor and monitor online content through teams of content moderators in addition to automated restrictions.</p><p>In addition, the authorities&nbsp;offer cash rewards to people for&nbsp;informing on one another. This&nbsp;became a formal policing method under the “Anti-Gang Crime” campaign that was adopted in 2018. The campaign has effectively&nbsp;criminalized and eliminated civil society activism in Tibetan areas. A retired senior official of the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) told Human Rights Watch in December 2019 that:</p><p>In Lhasa residential courtyards and neighborhood committees there are letter boxes, WeChat numbers, and notice boards for reporting people who say things that are not allowed to say, meet people they are not allowed to meet, spread “reactionary” talk they are not allowed to spread.... There are rewards ranging from RMB100 (US$14) to RMB10,000 ($1,400) according to the importance and the quality of the leads provided. The large rewards given to suppliers of major leads are announced in public for all to see.</p><p>A six-point public notice from the Qinghai Party Committee’s Internet Information Office in November 2024&nbsp;offers up to RMB100,000 ($14,000) for&nbsp;tipoffs on anyone writing online who commits offenses from a list that is largely political, starting with “opposing the leadership of the Party.”</p><p>In March 2022, the TAR Internet Illegal and Harmful Information Reporting Center received 1,395 reports, of which 35 percent were “politically harmful information,” 26 percent were “harmful information related to Tibet,” and 12 percent were “socially harmful information.” By comparison, “obscene and pornographic information”&nbsp;accounted for 6 percent of reports received.</p><p>Increased Manual Phone Searches<br />Intimidation and&nbsp;random searching of phones by police has been&nbsp;more frequent during&nbsp;security campaigns preceding sensitive anniversaries such as March 10 – the anniversary of the 1959 Lhasa uprising – or&nbsp;major political events in China such as the annual Chinese Communist Party meetings, based on reports. Police search people’s phones either by using&nbsp;phone scanning devices (known as Universal Forensic Extraction Devices, or UFEDs) that allow access to data on people’s phones or by forcing people to unlock their phones. Police have done this at&nbsp;checkpoints in Lhasa and other cities.</p><p>The first&nbsp;reports of Chinese police carrying out mass manual phone searches in rural areas of Tibet&nbsp;appeared in Tibetan exile media outlets in mid-2021. According to these reports, police in Sershul county, northwest Sichuan province,&nbsp;detained 117 Tibetans in 2021 for weeks of extrajudicial “political education” after the authorities&nbsp;claimed they had&nbsp;“banned content” on their phones. Since then, there have been several reports of manual phone searches to target Tibetans accused of sending news abroad:</p>In&nbsp;Drango county, Kandze prefecture, Sichuan province in February 2022, following the demolition of a giant Buddha statue by county authorities despite popular opposition, police&nbsp;conducted mass phone inspections searching for people who had&nbsp;reported this event online.In Derge county, Kandze prefecture, Sichuan province in February 2024, when local protests against dam construction attracted international attention, the authorities shut down internet services and made mass arrests, and police&nbsp;checked people’s WeChat and TikTok accounts to identify Tibetans who had posted reports of these events online.At Taktsang Lhamo monastery, Dzorge county, Ngawa prefecture, Sichuan province in October 2024, after Tibetan monks messaged contacts to say that their monastery school had been closed by Chinese authorities, authorities checked the phones of the monks and&nbsp;confiscated some of them.<p>Human Rights Watch has independently confirmed reports of local police systematically searching cell phones for banned text and images in rural areas in Nagchu municipality, TAR, that were not connected to specific incidents. In November 2021, a rural Nagchu resident told Human Rights Watch that leaders of his village committee ordered residents to gather at the village center to have their cellphones screened by the township police, particularly those of young people who might have “illegal” images of religious signs, content, or songs.&nbsp;</p><p>The police said if anyone is caught with such things, “the crime is more serious than killing,” as their family would also be affected. The resident said that this was not new but had been in place for several years, and some young men were&nbsp;detained for having such items in their phones.</p><p>Compulsory Download of Government ‘Anti-Fraud’ App<br />Media reporting on several Tibetan areas found that police have&nbsp;forced Tibetans to download a&nbsp;government app to their phones en masse at security checkpoints and during compulsory meetings, ostensibly to educate the public about online fraud. Official&nbsp;reports describe police and party members being&nbsp;mobilized to visit&nbsp;homes and&nbsp;businesses in Tibetan areas to “promote,” “guide,” and “assist” on the installation of the anti-fraud app, which China’s National Anti-Fraud Center created in 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>The research network Turquoise Roof&nbsp;conducted a technical analysis of the app that found that in addition to its stated purpose of countering online fraud and allowing them to report potential scams, the app “grants operators access to sensitive user data or control over key device functionalities, allowing for highly invasive surveillance.” When downloaded to a smart phone, according to the analysis, it can access a user’s data including sensitive personal information, activity logs, private messages, call records including time stamps and contact information, and browser history, all without the user’s consent and knowledge.</p><p>The app requires a user to scan their face and their ID card to begin using it, utilizing facial verification technology to compare images, and capturing biometric data that can be networked with other data sources in a large government database with data analytics capabilities to track and monitor people at population scale.&nbsp;</p><p>The forced download of the “anti-fraud” app has been reported elsewhere in China. Party workers have publicly&nbsp;complained about having to meet monthly app installation quotas as part of their performance evaluation. Given the severe repression in Tibetan areas, Tibetans have found it more even difficult to refuse to comply with these police orders.</p><p>Increasing Online Restrictions on Religion<br />In March 2022, Chinese internet management regulations&nbsp;banned in the TAR all religious content&nbsp;not authorized by the government. Authorization is&nbsp;granted only to religious teachers considered politically reliable. Many ordinary Tibetans, both monastic and laity, rely on the internet and social media for&nbsp;access to religious teachings and materials, particularly as the government has closely&nbsp;managed physical access to religion.</p><p>While similar regulations have been applied nationwide to eliminate religious expression not sanctioned by the state, implementation is particularly strict in Tibetan areas, where Tibetan Buddhism is considered a direct threat to the Chinese Communist Party’s legitimacy.&nbsp;</p><p>Police routinely question, detain, and criminally prosecute lay believers for circulating religious teachings online, exile media reported. Two women from Sershul county, Sichuan province, known for participating in local prayer meetings and social service initiatives were reportedly&nbsp;forcibly disappeared by police in December 2023, and their whereabouts remain unknown. Also that month, a court sentenced Semkyi Drolma, a young woman from Damshung county, Lhasa city, to 18 months in prison for “leaking state secrets.” Sources said her&nbsp;only offense was participating in religiously oriented WeChat groups.</p><p>The retired senior TAR official told Human Rights Watch in December 2019 that the authorities have for years subjected monks and nuns to greater online surveillance:</p><p>The government monitors the WeChat and social media activity of monks even more strictly than that of ordinary citizens. From what I hear, the internet monitoring units read and listen to each monk or nun’s WeChat individually, and apart from religious services inside the monastery or greeting their relatives, they are not allowed to take or send any photos of monastery sub-police stations, work team personnel, political education meetings, etc.</p><p>International and Domestic Law<br />The Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) – which China signed in 1998 but has not ratified – protect the rights to privacy, freedom of expression, association, peaceful assembly, and religion.&nbsp;</p><p>Both the Universal Declaration and the ICCPR state that “no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with their privacy, family, home, or correspondence,” and that “everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference.” Any interference with the right to privacy, including the collection, retention, and use of an individual’s personal data, must be necessary and proportionate, to pursue a legitimate aim, and subject to a clear and public legal framework.&nbsp;</p><p>For three decades since the introduction of the internet in China, the Chinese government has promulgated various laws and regulations that broadly prohibit a wide range of content on China’s internet, such as information that “incites subversion” or that “incites splittism,” including activities deemed to promote Tibetan independence. Such overbroad provisions are inconsistent with international human rights protections.</p><p>Current Chinese national laws do not meet privacy requirements provided for in international human rights law. The Chinese government has developed an increasingly sophisticated data regulatory regime since 2017, with the enactment of China’s&nbsp;Cybersecurity Law. It then promulgated various laws and regulations, including the Data Security Law in June 2021, and the Personal Information Protection Law in August 2021.&nbsp;</p><p>This evolving regime serves several purposes, which include regulating companies’ collection of consumer data, but also tightening government information control under the guise of “protecting national security” – whatever the Chinese Communist Party deems affects its hold on power – without providing meaningful protections against unlawful or abusive government surveillance.</p>

<p>(Johannesburg) –&nbsp;Mozambican authorities have failed to conduct credible investigations into the wave of political killings following the October 2024 general elections, Human Rights Watch said today. Unidentified gunmen, some wearing security force uniforms, shot dead at least 10 key opposition party officials from October through March 2025.</p><p>Most of the people targeted had been involved in organizing national street protests contesting the election results. They either belonged to the main opposition party, Optimistic People for the Development of Mozambique (Partido Optimista pelo Desenvolvimento de Moçambique, or Podemos) or were supporters of the independent presidential candidate, Venâncio Mondlane. The police have announced investigations into some of the cases but have not identified or arrested any suspects or provided public updates on the status of investigations.</p><p>“The failure of Mozambique’s police to credibly investigate the killings of key opposition members sends a chilling message that the authorities have no interest in bringing those responsible to justice,” said&nbsp;Ashwanee Budoo-Scholtz, deputy Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “Prompt, thorough, and effective investigations and fair prosecutions are needed if these apparently politically motivated killings are to stop.”</p><p>Human Rights Watch documented the killings of 10 opposition figures across the country through remote interviews with 21 people, including witnesses, relatives of the victims, journalists, and the police.</p><p>In one case, gunmen in a car ambushed Elvino Dias, the lawyer for Mondlane and the Podemos party, and Paulo Guambe, a Podemos election official, in Maputo and shot them dead. The other cases, most of them Podemos party officials and supporters, were similar.</p><p>On October 24, Mozambique’s election commission&nbsp;declared Daniel Chapo and his ruling party Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (Frente de Libertação de Moçambique, or Frelimo) the winners of the country’s October 9 general elections. The elections were marred by&nbsp;political killings,&nbsp;widespread irregularities, and tight restrictions&nbsp;on freedom of expression and assembly.</p><p>The opposition Podemos party contested the election results in nationwide demonstrations. Security forces cracked down on the protests, killing over 300 people and injuring hundreds more. Podemos submitted a report to the Office of the Attorney General alleging that more than 100 party members&nbsp;were killed and alleged that the police planned and carried out the killings.</p><p>Victims’ relatives and lawyers told Human Rights Watch that they regularly reached out to police for details of the investigations but did not receive any indication that there was any investigation under way or that authorities had identified a suspect in any of the cases. No updates were provided to family members or the public.</p><p>International human rights treaties to which Mozambique is party, including the&nbsp;African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights and the&nbsp;International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, obligate the government to investigate and prosecute alleged violations of human rights and provide appropriate remedies to victims.</p><p>The Southern African Development Community, the African Union, concerned governments, and major developmental partners of Mozambique should call on the government to ensure that there is a thorough investigation into the post-election violence, including apparent politically motivated killings, and fairly prosecute all those responsible, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>“Impunity for attacks against political rivals encourages further political violence and undermines democratic governance,” Budoo-Scholtz said. “The Mozambican authorities should order a serious and impartial investigation into abuses before, during, and since the October elections and hold all those responsible to account.”</p><p>For further details on politically motivated killings documented by Human Rights Watch, please see below.</p><p>The protests following the October 2024 elections in Mozambique drew thousands of people contesting their&nbsp;results as well as the rising cost of living and other social problems. They forced the temporary closure of banks, schools, and shops in Maputo and other cities. The media reported extensive&nbsp;looting and vandalism and cases of protesters&nbsp;killing police officers and&nbsp;destroying state and private structures and offices of the ruling party, Frelimo, across the country.</p><p>Security forces were&nbsp;implicated in serious human rights abuses, including the&nbsp;unlawful killing of over 300 protesters and bystanders, among them children. Security forces have also injured hundreds of people and arbitrarily detained thousands of others.</p><p>Opposition parties&nbsp;have alleged&nbsp;that agents of the National Criminal Investigation Service (Serviço Nacional de Investigação Criminal, SERNIC) have gone from house to house assaulting people accused of organizing demonstrations. Podemos alleged that 106 of its members and supporters&nbsp;have been murdered since the protests began.</p><p>The local monitoring group Plataforma Decide&nbsp;documented at least 18 killings of prominent opposition members across the country as of March 25.</p><p>Apparent Politically Motivated Killings Since October 2024</p><p>Elvino Dias and Paulo Guambe, in Maputo</p><p>On October 18, 2024, after 9 p.m., unidentified gunmen&nbsp;shot dead Elvino Dias, the lawyer for the Podemos party and independent presidential candidate, Venâncio Mondlane, and Paulo Guambe, a Podemos election official, in Maputo. A 27-year-old witness told Human Rights Watch that gunmen in civilian clothes, driving a white Mazda BT-50, ambushed the victims’ car as it made a turn onto Joaquim Chissano Avenue, firing several shots from what appeared to be Kalashnikov-style assault rifles. The Center for Democracy and Human Rights and the media reported that 25 bullet rounds&nbsp;were fired at the vehicle.</p><p>The police said the two men died at the scene. The attack drew worldwide condemnation, including from&nbsp;United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres. Following the attack, SERNIC&nbsp;reportedly confiscated the CCTV cameras from banks and an embassy near the scene, allegedly to assist with investigations. During a news conference on November 22, a SERNIC spokesperson said an investigation was underway, but no one has been arrested or charged with the killings, and there has been no public update on the status of the investigation.</p><p>Eugénio Raúl Madeira, in Zambezia Province</p><p>On December 22, in the early hours of the morning, unidentified gunmen fatally shot Eugénio Raúl Madeira, the Podemos mobilization secretary for Mocuba district, in Zambezia province, near his house. A friend of Madeira who witnessed the attack told Human Rights Watch that a white Toyota vehicle with tinted windows and without a license plate approached the square, as Madeira and others prepared to start their workday as moto-taxi drivers. The friend said that someone fired two bullets from inside the car, striking Madeira in the head:</p><p>We were positioning our motorbikes to start the day when this Toyota approached slowly. I initially thought it was a client, but I then realized the car didn’t have a license plate. While I was still trying to figure out what was happening, the window of the front passenger seat opened, a pistol emerged and fired two bullets straight at Eugénio’s head. He died there.</p><p>Madeira and another Podemos official, Xadreque Francisco, had been the party’s focal points in Mocuba district and leaders of the protests there. During a violent protest in November, Zambezia provincial police had&nbsp;accused the two men of acts of vandalism.</p><p>Four days after Madeira’s killing, three gunmen in civilian clothes broke into Francisco’s house early on December 22 and fired several shots, wounding him, the media&nbsp;reported.</p><p>Abudo Bacar Lawia, in Cabo Delgado Province</p><p>On the evening of January 3, 2025, Abudo Bacar Lawia, the chef mobilizer of the protests in the Montepuez district of Cabo Delgado province, was gunned down outside a friend’s house. The friend said that at about 8 p.m., as they stood by the gate of the compound, two men approached wearing the uniforms of the&nbsp;communal militia, a government-organized local counterterrorism force.</p><p>“We didn’t suspect them because we thought they were doing their normal night patrolling of the town,” the friend said. “Then suddenly I heard gunshots, and I lost consciousness. … I woke up at the hospital where I was treated for a gunshot injury [in the shoulder].”</p><p>Two witnesses, a friend of Lawia and a police officer, said that Lawia died after being hit in the chest by two bullets fired from a pistol.</p><p>Before his death, Lawia had received death threats in messages and phone calls, a relative told Human Rights Watch. “He was an open supporter of VM [Venâncio Mondlane] and didn’t shy away from leading and organizing protests,” he said. “Police officers warned him several times that he would be targeted one day, but he didn’t care.”</p><p>On January 6, a police spokesman for Cabo Delgado&nbsp;confirmed that the investigative police had collected evidence from the crime scene and that a criminal file had been opened. Human Rights Watch contacted the Cabo Delgado police spokesperson on February 7 via text message seeking an update on the status of the investigation. The spokesperson referred Human Rights Watch to her superiors, but the Cabo Delgado police did not respond to Human Rights Watch calls.</p><p>Rachide Eduardo, in Cabo Delgado Province<br /><br />Rachide Eduardo was shot and killed on January 6, at about 6 p.m., at his home in Ntutupue town, in the Ancuabe district of Cabo Delgado province. Eduardo was a Podemos party leader in Ntutupue and had helped organize and lead various anti-government demonstrations across the district. He was a close friend of Arlindo Chissale, a journalist actively supporting the opposition candidate, who was allegedly&nbsp;forcibly disappeared on January 7 by a group of men, three of whom wore military uniforms.</p><p>A neighbor of Eduardo said that on the night of his death, he heard several gunshots coming from inside his house. He saw two men quickly leave the premises and enter a Mahindra pickup vehicle, like those used by Mozambican security forces. He said:</p><p>I saw the car parked for about an hour outside Rachide’s house. It wasn’t the first time. Every now and then, that car would park in different places along our road. Sometimes the occupants wore uniforms … that dark green uniform like UIR [Unit of Rapid Intervention]. On the day they killed Rachide, the two assassins were wearing plain clothes.</p><p>Sande Antonio, in Sofala Province</p><p>Sande Antonio, 30, a Podemos party delegate in Sofala province, was shot dead at his home in Buzi town, in the early hours of January 16. A Podemos official, Vale Magalhaes,&nbsp;told the media that at about 1 a.m. that day, Antonio sent a text message saying that police officers had surrounded his home. When Magalhaes tried to phone Antonio, no one answered. He said he later received the news that unidentified gunmen had shot Antonio three times, “one [bullet] in his head, one in the chest, and another in the back.”</p><p>A journalist who had interviewed Antonio on several occasions said that the politician had fled his home for a safer location after he started receiving death threats for denouncing ballot stuffing during the elections.</p><p>The journalist said Antonio returned to his home on January 15 because he believed that it was safe to do so since Chapo&nbsp;had been sworn into office as president.</p><p>As of March 26, police had not made any public comments about Antonio’s killing. One of his relatives said that the police had informed the family that a criminal investigation had been opened and that they were trying to trace the gunmen, but no further information was provided.<br /><br />Daniel Guambe and Rafito Sitoe, in Inhambane Province</p><p>On March 8, at about 10 p.m., two gunmen stepped out of their car carrying Kalashnikov-style assault rifles and fired at least seven bullets at an Isuzu vehicle transporting two prominent Podemos members, Daniel Guambe, 28, and Rafito Sitoe, 21, in Massinga village, Inhambane province,&nbsp;various sources reported. Members of the community tried to rescue the men, but they died on their way to the hospital, Podemos confirmed&nbsp;in a statement. Days before the fatal attack, Sitoe and Guambe had led the preparations for a&nbsp;surprise visit by Mondlane to Massinga on February 26, a party official told Human Rights Watch.

<p>Global leaders need to respond to reports of fresh attacks by Sudan’s Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on the Zamzam displacement camp near North Darfur’s capital of El Fasher. The camp hosts at least half a million people who have fled past and present violence and abuse in Darfur.&nbsp;</p><p>In recent days, hundreds of desperate civilians have arrived in Tawila, a town 60 kilometers west of Zamzam, destitute, hungry, and thirsty, reporting that conditions in Zamzam had become unbearable.</p><p>Since May 2024, the RSF&nbsp;have besieged civilians living in and around El Fasher, cutting off supplies and shelling populated areas. The Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and their allied joint forces, which claim to be defending the city, have not appeared to take all feasible measures that they could to minimize harm to civilians, including during heavy fighting in and around populated areas.</p><p>The RSF attacked the Zamzam camp in February 2025, destroying civilian infrastructure. International bodies had earlier&nbsp;confirmed famine in the camp, but civilians there had largely been spared from the fighting. Following the new attacks, however, the handful of aid organizations operating in the camp, including&nbsp;Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors without Borders or MSF) and the United Nations’&nbsp;World Food Programme, halted services for civilians dying of hunger. &nbsp;</p><p>There have been worrying signs of a large-scale imminent attack for days. Abdel Raheem Dagalo, the deputy RSF leader, was recently filmed&nbsp;mobilizing forces engaged in El Fasher. On April 10, RSF shelling hit El Fasher’s Abu Shouk camp. Local responders&nbsp;reported more than a dozen people, including children, had died.</p><p>There were similar warning signs ahead of the RSF’s attacks on the suburb of Ardamata in El Geneina, the capital of West Darfur and the last safe haven for ethnic Massalit, in late 2023;&nbsp;a massacre of civilians ensued.</p><p>In June 2024, the UN Security Council passed a resolution condemning the RSF siege of El Fasher and pressing all parties to protect civilians, guarantee their safe movement, and calling for safe aid access. But the RSF has ignored these calls.</p><p>The consequences of a large-scale attack for the civilian population are all too clear. Global leaders need to act. The UN Security Council should meet and respond to the crisis, including by imposing sanctions on abusive commanders and condemning countries providing support to parties in violation of the ongoing UN arms embargo.</p>

Title    : US/El Salvador: Venezuelan Deportees Forcibly Disappeared

<p>(Washington, DC) – The governments of the&nbsp;United States and&nbsp;El Salvador have subjected more than 200&nbsp;Venezuelan nationals to enforced disappearances and arbitrary detention, Human Rights Watch said today.</p><p>On March 15, 2025, the US government&nbsp;removed 238 Venezuelans to El Salvador, where they were immediately&nbsp;transferred to the mega prison known as the Center for Confinement of Terrorism (Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, CECOT), known for its abusive conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, the Venezuelans have been held incommunicado. United States and Salvadoran authorities have not disclosed a list of the people removed, although CBS News published a&nbsp;leaked list of names. Relatives of people apparently transferred to El Salvador told Human Rights Watch that US authorities said that they were unable to share any information on their relatives’ whereabouts, while Salvadoran officials have been completely unresponsive.</p><p>“These enforced disappearances are a grave violation of international human rights law,” said&nbsp;Juanita Goebertus, Americas director at Human Rights Watch. “The cruelty of the US and Salvadoran governments has put these people outside the protection of the law and caused immense pain to their families.”</p><p>US authorities should publicly identify the Venezuelans who were removed to El Salvador. The Salvadoran government should confirm their current whereabouts, disclose whether there is any legal basis for their detention, and allow them contact with the outside world.</p><p>Human Rights Watch has so far interviewed 40 relatives of people apparently removed to El Salvador. Human Rights Watch sent a letter to Salvadoran authorities on April 5, asking for information on the identity of people detained, their conditions of detention in CECOT, and the legal basis for their detentions. The government of El Salvador has not responded.&nbsp;</p><p>All family members interviewed said that US immigration authorities initially told their relatives, who were in immigration detention, that they would be sent back to Venezuela. None of the detainees were told that they would be sent to El Salvador, the relatives said.</p><p>The US authorities&nbsp;announced on March 17 that 238 Venezuelans had been removed and had arrived in El Salvador. The government of El Salvador&nbsp;published a video showing the faces of some of them, but neither government published a list of the people who were sent to and detained at CECOT, nor explained the legal basis, if any, for their detention there. The same day, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt&nbsp;stated that 137 people had been deported under the&nbsp;Alien Enemies Act of 1798, an archaic and seldom-used statute that allows the president of the United States to order the arrest and removal of people connected to a “hostile nation or government.” Leavitt said 101 others had been removed under&nbsp;Title 8, pursuant to regular immigration procedures.</p><p>The Trump administration&nbsp;invoked the Alien Enemies Act against “Tren de Aragua,” a Venezuelan organized crime group. Yet, the government has produced no evidence establishing that the people removed are affiliated with Tren de Aragua. A US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) official&nbsp;acknowledged that “many” of those deported to El Salvador “do not have criminal records in the United States.” Additionally, many of the relatives of people sent to El Salvador shared with Human Rights Watch researchers government documents indicating they had “no criminal records” in Venezuela or in other countries in Latin America where they lived in recent years.&nbsp;</p><p>ICE maintains an Online Detainee Locator System (ODLS), which lawyers and relatives use to find people held during immigration proceedings. Human Rights Watch cross-referenced the case numbers of some of the deportees and confirmed that they had been removed from the system. ICE&nbsp;indicates on its website, most recently updated on April 7, 2025, that “the ODLS only has information for detained aliens who are currently in ICE custody or who were released from ICE custody within the last 60 days.” This seems to indicate that the names of the Venezuelans Human Rights Watch interviewed were deleted sooner than is standard ICE practice.</p><p>Some relatives said that when they called US detention centers or ICE offices to ask about their relatives’ whereabouts, officials told them that they could not provide any information, that their family members no longer appeared in the locator system, or that their whereabouts were unknown. In a few cases, officials informed them that their relatives had been removed from the United States, but did not say where they had been sent.</p><p>On March 20, CBS News obtained and published an internal US government list of names, without identification numbers, of people sent to El Salvador. Neither Salvadoran nor US authorities have confirmed the authenticity of the list, although Human Rights Watch found all the names of the cases it has documented on the list.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of the relatives interviewed said they are unfamiliar with the legal system in El Salvador and do not know which authorities they should contact to obtain information about their relatives.</p><p>Some said they emailed the Salvadoran presidential high commissioner for human rights and freedom of expression, Andrés Guzman, but have received only an automatic acknowledgment of receipt or a response indicating that their request had been forwarded to the “relevant institutions.” A Salvadoran lawyer representing several of the detainees told Human Rights Watch he has not been allowed to meet or speak with his clients.</p><p>The interviewees said that they believed their family members are in El Salvador because of compelling scraps of evidence they have been able to piece together. Some identified their relatives’ faces or parts of their bodies in a video posted by Salvadoran authorities. Others discovered that their family member’s names had been removed from ICE’s location database on or around March 16, or found their relative’s name on the CBS News list.</p><p>The Salvadoran government has articulated no legal basis for detaining the Venezuelan deportees and has offered no indication of when, if ever, they would be released from incarceration. It appears that their detention is wholly arbitrary and potentially indefinite; a grave violation of El Salvador’s human rights obligations, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>Under international law, an enforced disappearance occurs when authorities deprive a person of their liberty and then refuse to disclose that person’s fate or whereabouts. This violation is especially serious because it places people outside the protection of the law, making further abuses likely.</p><p>“Nobody should be forced to piece together bits of information from the media or to read into the authorities’ silence to find out where their relatives are being held,” Goebertus said. “Salvadoran authorities should urgently disclose the names and locations of all detainees transferred from the US, and allow them to contact their families.”</p>

Title    : Instead of Addressing Child Abuse Prevention, Trump Attacks Trans Youth

<p>In his&nbsp;proclamation for National Child Abuse Prevention Month, rather than addressing real threats to children like the federal government&nbsp;should do, United States President Donald J. Trump focused almost exclusively on attacking supporters of transgender youth. He declared broadly defined “gender ideology” as “one of the most prevalent forms of child abuse” and labeled gender-affirming care as “evil”.</p><p>Gender-affirming care is recognized as the gold standard of medical care for transgender youth by&nbsp;major&nbsp;medical&nbsp;associations. This care consists of social practices (changes to one’s name, wardrobe, etc.) to mental health counseling to medical interventions, such as puberty blockers and hormone therapies. In all, the care emphasizes a personalized, multidisciplinary, and gradual approach.&nbsp;Studies demonstrate that youth receiving this care experience 60 percent lower odds of depression and 73 percent lower odds of suicidality, with approximately&nbsp;98 percent of youth continuing this care into adulthood.</p><p>Contrary to the proclamation’s assertions about the prevalence of gender-affirming care, a dataset of private insurance claims from 2018-2022 covering more than 5 million adolescents found that&nbsp;less than 3,000 transgender youth had access to puberty blockers or hormone therapies. Currently,&nbsp;27 states ban some form of gender-affirming care for transgender youth.&nbsp;</p><p>A January 28, 2025,&nbsp;executive order aims to withdraw federal funds and support for such care to people younger than 19.</p><p>The proclamation’s language also echoes state-level efforts to weaponize child welfare systems against supportive families of transgender youth. In 2022, Texas Governor Greg Abbott&nbsp;ordered state agencies to investigate parents whose children receive gender-affirming care, jeopardizing their custodial rights. This year,&nbsp;Texas and&nbsp;Montana advanced legislation to classify some or all gender-affirming care as child abuse.</p><p>While the administration targets families of transgender youth, actual child welfare crises remain inadequately addressed, including the&nbsp;harm Black and Indigenous people and families living in poverty face in child welfare systems,&nbsp;the indiscriminate prosecution of children as adults,&nbsp;hazardous child labor conditions, and&nbsp;family separation at border facilities.</p><p>US officials should prioritize protecting children from genuine harms rather than threatening the wellbeing of supportive families.</p>

Title    : The Trump Administration’s Assaults on Black History
Published: Thu, 10 Apr 2025 06:00:00 -0400
Summary  :
<p>This week, it was reported that the United States National Park Service had begun&nbsp;scrubbing information from its exhibits about Harriet Tubman and the Underground Railroad; one of the most significant stories of resistance against chattel slavery in the United States. The move would have destroyed knowledge about how oppressed people in the United States have successfully fought for freedom. While the Park Service&nbsp;walked back the revisions after public outcry, it’s just one example of the Trump administration’s campaign to curtail understanding of racism’s legacy in the United States.</p>

<p>The erasure at the Park Service follows President Donald J. Trump’s recent&nbsp;executive order targeting the National Museum of African American History and Culture for being “divisive,” which led to museum director Kevin Young’s&nbsp;resignation last Friday. Leaders&nbsp;called the order a sign of the administration’s attempts to stifle cultural spaces dedicated to preserving Black history and truths that don’t align with Trump’s political ideology. The Institute for Museum and Library Studies has also been&nbsp;subjected to staff and funding cuts.</p><p>These actions&nbsp;continue similar efforts during Trump’s first term, including&nbsp;his ban on efforts to “inculcate” what he called “divisive concepts.” He was targeting work like the&nbsp;1619 Project, a publication exploring the enduring impacts of racial slavery in the United States, including in housing, incarceration, health care, and education. Trump also created the 1776 Commission, which aimed to produce “patriotic education” that whitewashed history and understated the role racism played in shaping US political, economic, and legal systems.&nbsp;</p><p>International human rights bodies have&nbsp;condemned these kinds of practices. The United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination maintains that states should “educate the population as a whole in a spirit of non-discrimination,” specifically regarding people of African descent. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights protects minorities’ rights to enjoy their culture, including in community with others. To exercise that right, people need access to accurate historical knowledge about their communities.</p><p>Assaults on historical truth serve a purpose. They prevent Americans from understanding that racism is less about individual blame, but is instead a system built and maintained through centuries of&nbsp;law,&nbsp;policy, and&nbsp;violence. The attacks also deny people access to models of courage and organized resistance like&nbsp;Tubman and the Underground Railroad. This isn’t only about the past; it’s about politicians trying to foreclose the possibility of confronting ongoing and future injustices.&nbsp;</p><p>People across the United States took to the streets last weekend&nbsp;to demand the Trump administration keep its “hands off” democracy. It should keep its hands off Black history too.</p>

<p align="left">New data from the World Health Organization reveals that many governments’ public funding of health care falls short of what is needed to meet their human rights obligations.</p><p align="left">The vast majority of people live in countries where low public funding undermines their access to health care. Sometimes this is due to major constraints like war and debt, but often governments just don’t prioritize it.</p><p align="left">Governments should ensure that everyone can achieve their right to health by reducing reliance on regressive sources of financing. Wealthier governments should support appropriate tax reforms and provide debt restructuring or relief when necessary.</p><p>(Geneva) –&nbsp;New data from the World Health Organization (WHO) reveals that many governments’ public funding of health care falls short of what is needed to meet their human rights obligations, Human Rights Watch said today.</p><p>Most people have little access to even&nbsp;healthcare services considered most “essential” by the United Nations. As global health systems worldwide recoil from the United States’&nbsp;sudden termination of much foreign aid and assistance, richer governments should consider debt restructuring or relief that, along with appropriate tax reforms, can help improve resourcing of public health care.&nbsp;</p><p>“The vast majority of people around the world live in countries where their access to health care is undermined in part by low public funding,” said&nbsp;Matt McConnell, economic justice and rights researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Sometimes this is because of major constraints like war and debt, but often governments just don’t prioritize it. Either way, people suffer.”</p><p>Human Rights Watch analyzed the most recent WHO&nbsp;Global Health Expenditure Database, which includes healthcare spending data from 2022 for more than 190 countries around the world. These data show that public funding for health care faltered as the Covid-19 pandemic waned and global inflation surged.&nbsp;</p><p>Under international law, all governments have obligations to respect, protect, and fulfill all economic, social, and cultural rights, including the right to health, which requires access to quality healthcare facilities, goods, and services. Countries must devote as many resources as possible to advancing the right to health and avoiding backsliding, which can occur when governments reduce funding for healthcare systems or fail to match their population’s growing requirements.&nbsp;</p><p>Most governments are not spending enough to ensure that healthcare systems can deliver on the right to health. In 2022, 141 governments spent less than 5 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP) on health care through public means, a widely accepted&nbsp;international spending benchmark for assessing healthcare spending. About 84 percent of the world’s population, or 6.6 billion people, lived in a country where public healthcare funding missed this benchmark that year.</p><p>Richer countries generally rely more heavily on public sources of funds to finance health care than poorer countries. But the level of public financial support governments provide varies widely among both rich and poor countries, indicating that this is at least in part the result of policy choices.&nbsp;</p><p>The relationship between public healthcare spending and improved health outcomes is complicated by many factors, including the&nbsp;social and&nbsp;commercial determinants of health. But these data also show that higher levels of public funding generally correlate with improved access to health care.</p><p>Decreases in public funding of health care need to be subject to human rights scrutiny and, unless fully justified by governments, as&nbsp;outlined by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, may constitute human rights violations.&nbsp;</p><p>Insufficient public funding shifts the burden of financing health care to individuals and households, which can significantly undermine access, particularly for people with low or irregular incomes. In many countries, including some of the world’s poorest, large segments of the population have no choice but to pay the costs themselves if they are to receive health care.&nbsp;</p><p>Such cost-based access barriers are incompatible with health care as a human right for all. They can also&nbsp;undermine people’s ability to pay for goods and services essential for realization of other human rights, including housing, food, and education.</p><p>Financial resources are limited and unevenly distributed, but WHO data shows that many governments could do better. If 17 low-tax governments had raised tax revenues in 2022 to 15 percent of GDP—a “tipping point” threshold identified by the World Bank that is well below the global average of 23 percent of GDP—they could have raised more than enough money to spend at least 5 percent of GDP on health care.&nbsp;</p><p>Many countries, particularly in the Global South, face significant financial and practical constraints to adequately fund health care through public sources. Some richer countries may have contributed to many of these constraints, including through the forced expropriation of resources, and should consider assuming a special responsibility to help alleviate them.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2022, at least 48 low- and middle-income governments paid more to service debt to foreign creditors than they spent on health care for their people. Funds from foreign governments or intergovernmental bodies such as the World Bank accounted for more than 20 percent of healthcare spending in 49 countries in 2022 and were the principal financing mechanism in 16 countries, many of which now face financial shortfalls following the United States’&nbsp;suspension of foreign aid and assistance and other potential funding cuts.&nbsp;</p><p>In January 2025, US President Donald J. Trump signed an executive order suspending about US$44 billion in foreign aid and assistance, disrupting an estimated&nbsp;$12.4 billion allocated toward addressing urgent health crises worldwide. While the administration subsequently issued limited waivers to allow some of these funds to continue supporting vital programs protecting and promoting human rights, the impacts of this suspension are still unfolding and are poised to further undermine the right to health in many countries.&nbsp;</p><p>The extent to which governments rely on taxes for social spending varies, but greater tax revenues can both increase the financial resources available to spend on social services like health care and address inequalities in the enjoyment of rights, while also&nbsp;possibly improving government accountability.&nbsp;</p><p>Governments should ensure the right to health by reducing reliance on regressive sources of financing like out-of-pocket costs and by increasing public revenues for health care through progressive taxes and reducing tax abuses, Human Rights watch said.&nbsp;</p><p>They should also ensure transparency and accountability by setting specific targets for their health spending such as a minimum threshold of 5 percent of GDP or 15 percent of government expenditures, as well as improving the collection and publication of reliable health spending data that track achievement toward such targets.&nbsp;</p><p>Wealthier governments should&nbsp;meet their obligations of international cooperation and assistance. Creditor governments should&nbsp;assess the impacts of debt payments on debtor governments’ abilities to meet human rights obligations and provide debt restructuring or relief when necessary to enable debtor governments to adequately fund health care. Such governments should also support rights-aligned reforms to international tax rules during the ongoing&nbsp;UN Tax Treaty negotiations, and provide financial support for multilateral global health initiatives, particularly amid the&nbsp;recent US withdrawal.</p><p>The next few months will provide multiple opportunities for governments to make progress toward the realization of the right to health, including at the&nbsp;78th World Health Assembly in May, at the&nbsp;4th International Conference on Financing for Development in June, and at the&nbsp;2nd World Social Summit in November.&nbsp;</p><p>“Who pays and how is a key factor is what makes healthcare systems more or less resilient to the kinds of shocks they’ve experienced in recent years,” McConnell said. “Reducing inequalities of healthcare financing between and within countries is essential to building healthcare systems that work for all and ensure we no longer leave billions of people behind.”&nbsp;</p><p>Analysis of Newly Available WHO Data on Healthcare Funding&nbsp;</p>



      
  
      




  

  
<p>As Human Rights Watch&nbsp;documented in 2024, the more a country spends on health care through domestically generated public sources such as tax revenues or social health insurance contributions, the less reliant its healthcare system is on fees paid out of pocket by individuals and households.&nbsp;</p><p>These out-of-pocket costs include a range of charges such as over-the-counter prices, deductibles, and copayments for a healthcare good or service. All out-of-pocket costs&nbsp;worsen health care inequalities by creating barriers to accessing health care based on the ability to pay.&nbsp;</p><p>The WHO considers it “catastrophic health spending” when a household must spend more than 40 percent of their combined income on health care after paying for things like food, housing, and utilities. According to WHO&nbsp;estimates, the risk that individuals in a country will reach that catastrophic threshold falls to negligible levels only when out-of-pocket costs average no more than 15 to 20 percent of a country’s total expenditures on health care.</p><p>Out-of-pocket costs financed more than 20 percent of the healthcare system in 126 countries in 2022, 7 more than the&nbsp;previous year. On average, only high-income countries (at 18.4 percent) kept out-of-pocket payments below the upper bound of this risk threshold for&nbsp;catastrophic health spending, while upper-middle (30.8 percent), lower-middle (35.6 percent), and low-income (42.6 percent) countries averaged far higher.&nbsp;</p><p>In 55 countries in 2022, out-of-pocket payments were the primary source of healthcare financing, surpassing all other forms of domestically generated public and private funding, as well as foreign sources of financing like aid and assistance. In 27 of these countries, out-of-pocket payments accounted for the majority of all money spent on health care, equal to more than three out of every four dollars spent on health care in Turkmenistan, Armenia, Afghanistan, and Nigeria.</p><p>In 2021, the most recent year with complete data, there was a moderate-to-strong relationship between a country’s share of healthcare spending coming from public funds and its achievement on the WHO’s Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Service Coverage Index, which assesses countries’ progress toward the&nbsp;UN Sustainable Development Goal 3.8.1 on “coverage for essential health services.”</p><p>Most Countries Still Missing the 5-Percent-Of-GDP Benchmark</p><p>Numerous studies from health economists&nbsp;have found that achieving&nbsp;UHC, a framework developed by the UN to measure access to health care and an important element of the right to health, generally requires that governments spend at least 5 to 6 percent of their GDP on health care.&nbsp;</p><p>Consistent with these findings, analysis of the newly available 2022 WHO data showslast year a moderate-to-strong correlation between public healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP and coverage for essential healthcare services as measured by the WHO’s&nbsp;UHC Service Coverage Index. Countries that met the 5-percent-of-GDP indicator in 2022 were also much less likely to depend on inherently regressive out-of-pocket costs to fund their healthcare system.&nbsp;</p>



      
  
      




  

  
<p align="left">In all, 141 governments spent less than 5 percent of their GDP on health care in 2022. Only high-income countries (at 5.8 percent) averaged above this benchmark, compared to upper-middle (4 percent), lower-middle (2.4 percent), and low-income (1.2 percent) countries. Notably, no low-income country met the benchmark.&nbsp;</p><p>Among all countries, the global average of public healthcare spending in 2022 was only 3.8 percent of GDP. While above the pre-pandemic average of 3.5 percent of GDP in 2019, this continued a trend of year-over-year decline since the mid-pandemic peak of 4 percent in 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>The changes in public funding during the pandemic were not evenly distributed. Between 2019 and 2022, healthcare spending declined as a share of GDP in 69 countries. In three of these countries—Suriname, the Marshall Islands, and Costa Rica—healthcare spending fell from above 5 percent of GDP to below 5 percent.</p>



      
  
      




  

  
<p align="left">Assessing healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP helps control for differences in the size of countries’ economies, but changes in the percentage over time can hide stagnation or decline in absolute terms. For example, if spending as a percentage of GDP stays the same while a country’s GDP shrinks, hospitals and clinics can receive less funding.&nbsp;</p><p>Some countries hardest hit by economic and political crises during the pandemic, such as Lebanon and Afghanistan, experienced declines in both GDP and public health spending as a share of GDP. This means that their actual healthcare spending dropped more than changes in their healthcare spending as share of GDP would suggest.&nbsp;</p><p>In other countries, GDP grew over this period while public health spending as a percent of GDP declined, such as in Guyana, Ireland, Bangladesh, and Tanzania. Still other countries’ public spending increased faster than GDP, indicating a higher prioritization of healthcare spending, including many countries in the Global South, such as Nepal, Benin, Côte d’Ivoire, Zimbabwe, and Guinea Bissau.</p>



      
  
      




  

  
<p>Most Countries are Still Not Meeting the 15-Percent-of-Government-Expenditures Benchmark</p><p>On average, a country’s national budget equates to about one-third of its GDP; in 2022, it was 33.5 percent globally. If a country’s budget-to-GDP ratio is around this global average, 15 percent of its national budget will equate to about 5 percent of GDP, the level of public investment that generally corresponds to better healthcare access and outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p>This 15-percent-of-budget measure is another good indicator and goal for governments that seek to improve healthcare systems. In part because of this, countries in the African Union made an explicit commitment to meet this 15-percent-of-budget benchmark in the 2001&nbsp;Abuja Declaration on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Other Related Infectious Diseases.</p><p>Even so, in 2022, 147 countries spent less than 15 percent of their national budgets on health care. This means that about 6.6 billion people—or 83 percent of the world’s population—lived in a country that did not reach the threshold.</p><p>In 2022, public funding for health care as a share of government budgets was above pre-pandemic levels. Globally, the average rose from about 10.4 percent in 2019 to 10.8 percent in 2022. But these changes in public funding during the pandemic were not evenly distributed.&nbsp;</p>



      
  
      




  

  
<p>Inflation-Adjusted Changes in Healthcare Spending Per Capita Between 2019 and 2022</p><p>Trends in public healthcare spending during the pandemic are most stark when data is adjusted for changes in inflation, purchasing power, and population growth.&nbsp;</p><p>On average, the real value—the actual purchasing power—of per capita public healthcare spending around the world grew by about 27 percent between 2019 and 2022. Nevertheless, 37 countries experienced declines in the real value of their public healthcare spending from pre-pandemic levels, such as Lebanon and Malawi, where spending respectively declined by 71 and 41 percent between 2019 and 2021.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Funding Health Care is a Policy Choice</p><p>Some governments provided far more public funding for health care than their peer-income-country average in 2022. In The Gambia, for example, public funds accounted for 46.9 percent of all healthcare spending, more than twice the average for low-income countries (about 22 percent) and even greater than the average among considerably richer, lower-middle income countries (about 40 percent).&nbsp;</p>

<p>In contrast, some governments spent far less than their peers. Some of the governments, whose public healthcare spending fell significantly short of their income-group peers, were experiencing armed conflicts or significant social and economic upheaval. Others may have faced different constraints that made funding healthcare difficult, including public debt.</p><p>Increasing Public Revenues for Healthcare Spending</p><p align="left">There is no international tax benchmark.&nbsp;World Bank research has identified 15 percent of GDP as a minimum tax threshold, or “tipping point,” beyond which low-income countries are better able to graduate to middle-income status. But this rather low threshold may not be appropriate for all countries.</p><p>According to&nbsp;data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which publishes tax data on 130 countries,&nbsp;total tax revenues equated to about 23 percent of GDP on average across all countries in 2022. Only low-income countries (at 13.5 percent) averaged below this 15-percent-of-GDP indicator that year, while lower-middle (17.3), upper-middle (20.1), and high-income countries (32.0) came in above it.&nbsp;</p><p>Comparing governments’ public healthcare spending to their tax-to-GDP ratio shows that countries that spent less on health care (as measured against international benchmarks) had significantly lower tax revenues.&nbsp;</p><p>Among the 43 countries with OECD tax data that spent more than 5 percent of GDP on health care in 2022, tax revenues amounted to 31.8 percent of GDP on average. The remaining 87 countries that did not meet the 5 percent benchmark in 2022 had tax revenues equal to just 18.8 percent of GDP on average.&nbsp;</p><p>No country managed to spend more than 5 percent of GDP on health care that year with tax revenues below 15 percent of GDP.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of these very low-tax governments could significantly increase healthcare spending by raising tax revenues to just this 15-percent-of-GDP measure, which is only slightly above the current average for low-income countries.&nbsp;</p><p>For 17 of these governments, shown below, raising tax revenues to 15 percent of GDP from current levels could generate enough additional funds to fully meet 5 percent of GDP healthcare spending. An additional 35 governments could meet the 5 percent benchmark by increasing tax revenues to the average for their income group. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The government of Sri Lanka, for example, generated the equivalent of about 7.4 percent of GDP through taxes in 2022, while spending only about 1.8 percent of GDP on health care. Meeting the 5-percent-of-GDP healthcare spending benchmark would require an additional US$108 per person of public healthcare spending, while increasing taxes to 15 percent of GDP could generate an additional $252 per person.&nbsp;</p><p>Increasing tax revenues can be politically and practically difficult, particularly for low- and middle-income governments that face strong external constraints, including a global&nbsp;race-to-the-bottom for corporate tax rates and&nbsp;harmful conditionalities attached to loans from actors such as the International Monetary Fund. Additionally, some taxes support the realization of rights better than others.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, as&nbsp;recently recognized in a statement by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, value-added taxes (VAT) are inherently regressive and can partly offset the benefits of increased social spending made possible by those taxes. As such, it is important for governments to ensure that their tax revenues are generated in an equitable manner. UN member states&nbsp;currently negotiating a first global treaty on international tax cooperation should also press for rights-aligned reforms to international tax rules.</p><p>Debt is a Major Impediment to Healthcare Spending for Many Governments&nbsp;</p><p>Greater international cooperation around resolving public debt is also vital for helping governments increase healthcare spending, as such debts significantly hamper the efforts of many countries, like Sri Lanka, to fund public services.&nbsp;</p><p>Many governments spend significant amounts paying off debts that the government accrued over time. The cost of servicing this public debt can often greatly exceed public healthcare spending.&nbsp;</p>



      
  
      




  

  
<p align="left">The&nbsp;World Bank’s Debtor Reporting System has data for 116 of about 132 low- and middle-income countries. When measured in US dollars per capita, 48 of these countries spent more servicing their external public and publicly guaranteed debts in 2022 than they did on health care.&nbsp;</p><p>The government of Mongolia, for example, spent US$158 per person on health care through public means in 2022, which equated to about 3.1 percent of GDP. But that same year, Mongolia spent the equivalent of about $631 per person in the country to repay its obligations to creditors.</p><p>Such external debt obligations can form major constraints on many governments’ ability to adequately fund health care. Of the 141 governments that spent less than the 5 percent of GDP on health care through public means in 2022, at least 30 paid more to creditors than the amount needed to increase public healthcare spending to meet the 5 percent benchmark. To meet 5 percent of GDP, for example, Mongolia would have needed to increase public healthcare spending by an additional $95 per person in 2022; just 15 percent of what they paid to creditors that year.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Download the Data Used on this Article</p>

<p>(Nairobi) – South Sudan’s use of improvised air-dropped incendiary weapons has killed and horrifically burned dozens of people, including children, and destroyed civilian infrastructure in Upper Nile state, Human Rights Watch said today. The government’s use of these weapons in populated areas may amount to war crimes.</p><p>Interviewees described the use of improvised incendiary weapons in at least four attacks in Nasir, Longechuk, and Ulang counties, Upper Nile state, which killed at least 58 people and burned others severely. The United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS), which has a&nbsp;robust mandate to protect civilians, should establish temporary operating bases in high risk areas, and proactively respond to the deteriorating situation. UN Security Council members should urge South Sudan to cease its unlawful attacks and call for the urgent deployment of peacekeeping forces to the affected areas.</p><p>“These weapons have killed dozens of people, including children, and left survivors with severe burn injuries causing long-term harm,” said&nbsp;Nyagoah Tut Pur, South Sudan researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The government should immediately stop using indiscriminate incendiary weapons on communities, facilitate safe aid access, and the UN should urgently deploy peacekeepers to the affected areas.”</p><p>The government’s&nbsp;aerial bombardments intensified from March 16, 2025, after a March 4 attack on a&nbsp;government military base and&nbsp;Nasir town by armed Nuer youth known as the “White Army” and a March 7&nbsp;attack by armed men on a UN helicopter that killed a UN crew member and over two dozen South Sudanese soldiers.</p>

<p>On March 17, South Sudan’s information minister said its air force had bombed “so called White Army areas” and falsely implied that civilians who failed to leave the areas&nbsp;could lawfully be targeted. He revealed that Uganda was&nbsp;providing technical support to the South Sudan People’s Defence Forces (SSPDF), which Uganda has&nbsp;acknowledged.</p><p>A Ugandan forces’ spokesperson told Human Rights Watch that their support did not include aerial or ground attacks but could, if requested and they deemed it necessary. The Ugandan forces previously&nbsp;refuted allegations that it had targeted civilians and civilian objects and or used “chemical weapons and barrel bombs.”&nbsp;</p><p>Incendiary weapons&nbsp;inflict excruciating burns and other physical injuries, which can lead to&nbsp;psychological harm and lifelong scarring and disability, which can result in social and economic exclusion. They also&nbsp;cause fires that can indiscriminately destroy civilian objects. Use of these weapons in populated areas violates international humanitarian law, and if done with criminal intent, constitutes a war crime.&nbsp;</p><p>Protocol III to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons explicitly prohibits using air-dropped weapons designed to set fires and burn people in “concentrations of civilians.” While South Sudan is not party to this protocol, its use of these weapons highlights the need to strengthen the international law that governs them.&nbsp;</p><p>Eight people interviewed, including witnesses, local responders, and two government officials, described the March 16 attack on Mathiang, in Longechuk county.&nbsp;</p><p>Witnesses described “barrels”—improvised incendiary weapons—being dropped from what appeared to be a multi-engine aircraft. A 39-year-old woman said: “It came swooping down, I thought it was going to fall on our compound…. Then we saw it drop barrels. As they dropped, [they caught fire].”&nbsp;</p><p>Another woman, 40, woke up feeling “the earth shaking…,” and ran outside … “only to see the village on fire.” She later saw the charred bodies of her neighbors, Khor Ruach Kerjiok, his wife, and their two children under age 10. Another resident said that the burned bodies of two older women aged 60 and above, Nyedier Kuach and Nyeget Kier, were found at home.</p><p>A senior health official said that at least 21 people were killed, 3 of whom died while being transported to Ethiopia for treatment. Health workers responding with very limited resources said the victims had extensive burn injuries. One said the burns continued to spread on the patients’ bodies, indicating that a substance that causes burns was used in the attack.</p><p>Accounts from witnesses describing what they saw and could smell when the improvised incendiary weapons were dropped, indicate that several types of flammable substances are being used as incendiary agents.&nbsp;</p><p>One responder explained how “[t]he area where the [flammable substance] landed was burning for some days, making crackling sounds.” Rain eventually extinguished the fires, “But it still smells … not like gasoline or kerosene,” he said.</p><p>Several residential compounds were burned, along with, a responder said, part of the market and two water pumps.&nbsp;</p><p>A video posted on social media on March 17 shows a fissure in the ground with visible active fire inside. The video reveals a large, burned area, including several tukuls (homes). Satellite imagery shows a burn scar appeared between March 16 to 17, along with burned tukuls 100 meters northeast of the market.</p>

<p>Two witnesses said at least three women suffered miscarriages or stillbirths following the bombing.&nbsp;</p><p>Air-dropped improvised incendiary weapons were also used in Nasir town on March 16 and 19. Two officials said that at least 22 people were killed and dozens of homes burned. Human Rights Watch has also reviewed satellite imagery showing burn scars and burned structures, including a former UNMISS site and dozens of structures along the main road between March 16 and 20.</p>

<p>Interviewees and photographs suggest that an incendiary weapon was also dropped in Kuich in Ulang county on March 21. Three witnesses describe seeing what appeared to be a propeller-driven aircraft drop incendiary substances in barrels.&nbsp;</p><p>“[The aircraft] dropped something that was on fire and there was a loud explosion [when it hit the ground] and immediately the surrounding caught fire,” one person said. Everyone started running in different directions.” When he returned to the site, he learned that “people [had been] killed on the spot and many people were seriously injured.”</p><p>Four witnesses said the attack killed 15 people, including 3 children, and seriously burned 17 others. A responder in Ulang town described victims, most with burn injuries, “their black skin is coming out. One man who died at the hospital was burned even his teeth. I also saw an older woman in her 70s, she had big blisters.” As of March 30, seven remained in critical condition.&nbsp;</p><p>Civilian structures burned included a nutrition center and a healthcare clinic. A guard there, Duop Bichiok Diew, in his 50s, died from burn injuries. Shelters and a market were also destroyed.&nbsp;</p><p>Photographs posted on social media on March 24, show several structures reduced to ashes near Sobat River in Kuich. Next to the nutrition center, visible impact sites were still burning. Satellite imagery confirmed that at least a dozen structures burned between March 21 and 22.</p>

<p>Government attacks on populated areas in the three counties, notably with helicopter gunfire and munitions continue, putting civilians at further risk and worsening the humanitarian situation, which already included a cholera outbreak.&nbsp;</p><p>Tens of thousands of people have fled, including into Ethiopia. Humanitarian access remains heavily constrained, as aid organizations&nbsp;face violence as well as&nbsp;bureaucratic restrictions.</p><p>South Sudan remains under a&nbsp;UN arms embargo prohibiting external military support to the country’s warring parties. Ugandan forces’&nbsp;participation in the operations violates the embargo. The Security Council should call out Uganda’s violations and ensure renewal of the embargo to protect civilians from unlawful violence, Human Rights Watch said. The council should press South Sudan to ensure that the UN mission can safely operate and approve any requests for additional UN troops.</p><p>“As the government of South Sudan continues to show utter disregard for civilians, it is now dropping flaming barrels of fire from the air,” Pur said. “The international community should press the government to end these unlawful attacks and ensure concrete steps to protect civilian lives.”</p>

M23 has been progressively taking over territory in eastern DRC since 2022, and the fighting intensified in January 2024, causing mass casualties and displacement. The conflict has impacted people’s access to health care, food, and other basic needs, triggering mass waves of displacement and raising the risk of disease outbreaks.&nbsp;</p><h4>2025 escalation</h4><p>M23/AFC is now in control of parts of North Kivu, including Goma, and has quickly continued its advance into South Kivu, capturing the strategic towns of Kalehe and Kavumu. As a result of the fighting, many people—including those who were already displaced—are <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/dr-congo-msf-calls-dignified-and-voluntary-returns-displaced-people" title="DR Congo: MSF calls for dignified and voluntary returns for displaced people">now on the move again</a>. &nbsp;</p><p>Despite the hostilities, MSF teams continue to provide medical assistance to affected communities through regular and emergency projects in North and South Kivu. &nbsp;</p><p>Armed clashes with the M23/AFC are also taking place in other parts of North Kivu, such as Masisi and Mweso, where we are carrying out medical activities, as well as in South Kivu, where M23/AFC have also made progress in recent weeks, taking over the town of Kalehe and moving the front line to just a few kilometers away from Kavumu. Fighting in the region is ongoing and continues to trigger population movements further south.</p><h4>MSF response in Goma</h4><p>In the first days of the escalation in Goma, the fighting forced MSF to partially reduce activities in some displacement camps and temporarily withdraw some staff from several medical facilities and offices in Goma, however we continued to care for the wounded at Kyeshero Hospital. After several days of violence and looting in Goma, the situation de-escalated somewhat, allowing MSF teams to resume activities in and around Goma. These activities include:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>supporting Kyeshero and Virunga hospitals in treating wounded people;</li><li>collecting and distributing blood bags for overwhelmed hospitals;&nbsp;</li><li>returning to several displacement sites to support local health centers; expand or re-establish cholera treatment units and special clinics for survivors of sexual violence; provide food, water, and fuel for water pumping stations; and empty latrines and install hand-washing facilities. &nbsp;</li></ul><p>Priorities at this stage remain caring for the wounded and reducing the risk of cholera outbreaks, which is a concern due to unsafe water sources, inadequate sanitation, and displacement. MSF teams continue to assess humanitarian needs every day, both in the camps and in the city of Goma, as the impact on the population is enormous. The next few days will allow us to assess the next steps.&nbsp;</p></div>

    <div class="body-text  "><p>Over 8 million people are internally displaced across DRC, including 500,000 who have been displaced by the current fighting since January 2025. &nbsp;The situation for displaced people was already dire before the current escalation, particularly in the camps around Goma. Over the years they have grown more crowded and living conditions have deteriorated further, with severely limited access to basic needs such as proper shelter, food, water, sanitation facilities, and health care. Displaced people living in these conditions face high risk of falling ill.</p><p>For people leaving the camps, MSF is particularly concerned about the level of access to health services when they arrive in their new location. After several years of war, many health facilities have been looted or abandoned and will be unable to provide adequate medical care to those who need it, either now or in the longer term. The situation in the places people have fled is likely to be equally disastrous if NGOs, UN agencies, and authorities fail to provide the minimum level of essential services.</p><p>To ensure a minimum level of health care for displaced people in areas of return, MSF has set up mobile clinics on roads leading out of Goma to the east and the north. MSF teams are also carrying out assessments in the areas to which people are returning.</p><p>Many of the already-displaced people living in these camps are fleeing yet again, as the fighting has taken place in and around Goma. While many are returning to their places of origin—where they originally fled from—others are fleeing across the border to other countries, such as <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/where-we-work/burundi" title="Burundi">Burundi</a>. That’s why, in addition to our response within DRC, MSF has <a href="https://x.com/MSF/status/1891771122338722040">sent a team</a> to Burundi’s Citiboke province to assess needs and provide emergency assistance for arriving refugees.&nbsp;</p></div>

In <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/four-questions-about-whats-going-eastern-dr-congo" title="Four questions about what’s going on in eastern DR Congo">some areas</a>, MSF has been alone in addressing medical and humanitarian needs, which far outweigh our capacity to respond. &nbsp;</p><p>Since January 2025, humanitarian needs have been skyrocketing even more. MSF teams have witnessed some people dismantling humanitarian facilities and taking with them anything that could potentially be of use: chairs, metal sheeting, tarpaulins, ropes and so on. &nbsp;</p><p>Humanitarian organizations must be guaranteed access to all places of return, and returnees must be able to access essential health services, including support for survivors of sexual violence. Failure to provide these services risks exacerbating people’s health needs.&nbsp;</p></div>

Cholera and skin infections thrive in settings with a contaminated water supply, while mosquitoes that spread diseases like malaria and dengue, which breed in standing water, proliferate.</p><p>To curb the spread of disease in camps, MSF provides clean drinking water and constructs and improves water and sanitation infrastructure, including latrines and showers. MSF built a <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/turning-taps-gomas-makeshift-camps" title="Turning on the taps in Goma’s makeshift camps ">water pumping and chlorination station</a> on the shores of Lake Kivu that processes up to 2 million liters (more than 500,000 gallons) of water each day and distributed hundreds of thousands of gallons of potable water each day to camps around Goma in 2023. We also built a 2-mile pipeline to connect Lushagala camp to a water treatment plant in Bulengo, and installed a platform to distribute up to 200,000 liters (more than 50,000 gallons) of water per day in Rusayo. In response to the <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/congo-river-floods-leave-families-no-means-support" title="Congo River floods leave families with no means of support">Congo River floods</a> in early 2024, MSF teams installed latrines, showers, and lighting; and distributed tents and drinking water to people affected.&nbsp;</p></div>

    <div class="body-text  "><p>Since the start of the war in October 2023, more than 48,000 <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/where-we-work/palestine" title="Palestine">Palestinians</a> have been killed in Gaza, more than 112,000 wounded, and thousands are estimated to be buried under the wreckage. Over 1.9 million people—90 percent of the entire population—have been forcibly displaced, often many times. Water and food are still severely limited, essential supplies like fuel and electricity are scant, and as the threat of disease and starvation continues, lifesaving health care remains inaccessible.&nbsp;</p><p>Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams are witnessing firsthand how this war has turned Gaza's chronic humanitarian crisis into a catastrophe.</p></div>

This is why <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/water-resource-more-precious-each-day-gaza" title="Water: A resource more precious each day in Gaza">water distribution</a> is an important part of MSF’s response. &nbsp;</p><p>In January 2025, MSF distributed 500,000 liters of desalinated water per day at more than 64 water points across Al-Mawasi, Khan Younis, Rafah, and Deir al-Balah. Since the ceasefire was implemented, our teams have also started water trucking activities in the north to increase access. We are continuously working to increase distribution as drinkable water remains scarce in Gaza. &nbsp;</p><p>In Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, MSF has been implementing water and sanitation activities in camp shelters through a partnership with the Agriculture Development Association (PARC). This includes building latrines, distributing hygiene kits, and providing water treatment units.

    <div class="body-text  "><p>The medical needs in Gaza are immense. Many Palestinians require urgent assistance—including people trapped under rubble, pregnant women who are about to deliver, and the elderly—and are not able to access the care they need. The core needs MSF is seeing and seeking to address include: &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h4>Health care infrastructure</h4><p>The <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/gaza-threat-rafah-ground-invasion-looms-silent-killings-continue" title="Gaza: &quot;Silent killings&quot; continue as Rafah invasion looms">collapse</a> of health care infrastructure due to repeated attacks and lack of supplies has made medical care increasingly inaccessible as the overwhelming needs continue to grow. There have been more than 500 attacks on health care since the war started, according to <a href="https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-221-gaza-strip">OCHA</a>, and out of the 36 main hospitals serving over 2 million people in Gaza, only 17 are functional—and only partially so.&nbsp;</p><h4>War wounds, crush injuries, and burns care</h4><p>War wounds, crush injuries, and burns treatment remain an urgent need as Israeli bombardment and attacks continue. But with very little capacity inside hospitals and a dire lack of medical supplies, people aren’t getting the care they need to heal properly or even survive.</p><h4>Infections</h4><p>Infections resulting from poorly treated wounds are a growing concern, driven by the difficulty wounded people face accessing care and follow-up, shortages of supplies, and lack of access to hygiene.</p><h4>Disease outbreaks</h4><p>Infectious diseases including diarrhea, acute respiratory infections, skin infections, and hepatitis are on the rise due to overcrowding and poor hygienic conditions in camps where displaced people are sheltering, and <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/msf-supported-facilities-across-gaza-face-critical-shortages-medical-supplies" title="Gaza: Critical shortages of medical supplies in MSF-supported facilities">shortages</a> of medicines and medical supplies.</p><h4>Starvation</h4><p>Starvation is inevitable under the Israeli government’s policy of deliberate deprivation, and we are already seeing the impacts of food insecurity and hunger. According to the Integrated Food Security Classification (IPC), almost half a million people (22 percent of the population of Gaza) are facing catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity, and the high risk of famine will persist across the whole Strip as long as the war continues and humanitarian access remains restricted. &nbsp;</p><h4>Maternal and child care</h4><p>In addition to the destruction or closures of once-functioning hospitals, the decimation of infrastructure has created severe obstacles for pregnant women trying to reach medical facilities. <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/what-its-be-pregnant-gaza" title="What it's like to be pregnant in Gaza right now">Pregnant women</a> are often forced to navigate unsafe routes amid the fighting and without safe transportation—often delaying access to health care and putting them at higher risk of complications.&nbsp;</p></div>

    <div class="body-text  "><p>For nearly two years, large parts of Sudan have been experiencing ongoing violence, including intense urban warfare, gunfire, shelling, and airstrikes. The health system, already fragile before the conflict started, is struggling to cope with existing and emerging medical needs while facing overwhelming pressure from the destruction and looting of health facilities, acute shortages of utilities and medical supplies, and under-resourced, unpaid, and overworked personnel. As a result, people face significant challenges accessing medical care throughout the country.</p><h4>What to know about the war in Sudan</h4><h5>It’s led to the world’s largest displacement crisis.&nbsp;</h5><p>The war in Sudan has forced more than 12 million people—over 1 in 5 Sudanese—to flee their homes in the nearly two years since it started, including over 3 million who have crossed its borders into neighboring countries like Chad and South Sudan, where MSF is providing assistance for refugees and returnees. Many displaced people are sheltering in crowded camps established in the aftermath of the 2003 Darfur crisis, with no roof over their heads to protect them from the rain and scorching summer heat.</p><h5>Sudan's health system has collapsed.&nbsp;</h5><p>Sudan’s health system was already fragile before this conflict. Today, artillery attacks, the occupation of hospitals by armed forces, power outages, and shortages of medical supplies and personnel have brought Sudan’s health system to the brink of collapse. Millions of Sudanese lack access to essential medical care despite alarming needs.</p><h5>The war in Sudan is a war on people.&nbsp;</h5><p>People in Sudan continue to be subjected to horrific violence as warring parties attack each other with little respect for civilian life. The violence has also taken on an ethnic dimension in Sudan’s Darfur region, which was devastated by another war in the early 2000s. Refugees who have fled from West Darfur to Chad describe an unbearable spiral of violence, with looting, homes burned, beatings, sexual violence, and massacres, particularly targeting the Masalit ethnic minority.</p><p>Civilians, residential areas, infrastructure, health workers, and health facilities must be protected.</p><h5>The humanitarian response remains critically underfunded.&nbsp;</h5><p>It’s also hindered by restricted access to conflict zones. An urgent-scale-up of humanitarian response is needed to meet the needs of people in Sudan. MSF is one of the few international organizations working in parts of Sudan that are most heavily impacted by the violence. The UN and other humanitarian organizations are barely visible on the ground beyond the main entry points in the east (Port Sudan) and west (El Geneina). This is partly due to the mounting violence, lawlessness, and access challenges imposed by both parties to the conflict.</p></div>

In 2024, multiple screenings carried out by MSF and Sudanese health authorities in the camp indicated alarming and worsening rates of malnutrition. On August 1, 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee concluded that <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/sudan-after-famine-declaration-catastrophic-malnutrition-zamzam-camp-only-getting-worse" title="Sudan: After famine declaration, catastrophic malnutrition in Zamzam camp is only getting worse">famine conditions</a> were prevalent in the area.</p><h5>Access to health care&nbsp;</h5><p>Sudan’s health system was already fragile before this conflict. Today, artillery attacks, the occupation of hospitals by armed forces, power outages, and shortages of medical supplies and personnel have brought Sudan’s health system to the brink of collapse. Active fighting and lack of transportation hinder patients’ ability to reach the health facilities that are functioning. By the time many arrive at a hospital, they are in critical condition; pregnant women often have to give birth at home.</p><h5>Disease outbreaks&nbsp;</h5><p>Before the current war, Sudan had a high prevalence of non-communicable diseases and faced both seasonal and non-seasonal outbreaks of diseases like <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/measles" title="Measles">measles</a> and <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/cholera" title="Cholera">cholera</a>. Now, as the ongoing conflict has disrupted essential services such as water supply and the availability of medicine, the health situation has become even more dire.</p><div class="ckeditor-readmore-wrapper"><div class="ckeditor-readmore"><p>As people flee to overcrowded camps, the risk of disease outbreaks has risen, especially among children. The lack of availability and access to vaccinations has left many children unvaccinated, heightening the risk of deadly but vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles.</p><p>In addition, people with chronic diseases such as <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/diabetes" title="Diabetes">diabetes</a>, asthma, and heart disease are facing serious complications due to lack of medicines and lack of access to functional health facilities.</p></div></div><h5>Surgery and emergency care&nbsp;</h5><p>The war has put intense pressure on hospitals with surgery and emergency departments. MSF teams are seeing war-wounded patients with catastrophic injuries caused by explosions, bullets, and stabbings, and are responding to mass casualty incidents. People injured in road traffic accidents and women in need of emergency cesarean sections also face difficulty accessing care.</p><h5>Maternal and pediatric care&nbsp;</h5><p>Pregnant women and children residing in camps, particularly in the western, southern, and eastern regions of the country, are especially vulnerable to health risks due to harsh living conditions and the insufficient humanitarian response. Women often give birth in unsanitary tents or at home, increasing the risk of complications and infections, while access to <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/maternal-health" title="Maternal health">maternal health</a> care remains insufficient.</p><p>At the same time, the need for postnatal and pediatric care is immense. Children under 5 years old, especially newborns and toddlers, have an increased likelihood of contracting diseases and are more vulnerable to complications from malnutrition, <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/malaria" title="Malaria">malaria</a>, measles, or acute watery diarrhea.</p><h5>Obstruction of humanitarian access&nbsp;</h5><p>Throughout the war, there has been a systematic obstruction of aid, humanitarian access, and supplies. It has been difficult to get visas for humanitarian staff to enter the country and travel permits to move around Sudan. Permits to cross front lines have repeatedly been denied. Attempts have also been made to prevent aid from entering the country, including from Chad and South Sudan.</p><h5>Mental health&nbsp;</h5><p>The war and violence continue to have serious <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/mental-health" title="Mental health">mental health</a> implications for people fleeing or stuck in the midst of the fighting. People continue to experience extreme trauma as they lose family members and loved ones; witness and experience violence, including <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/sexual-and-gender-based-violence" title="Sexual and gender-based violence">sexual violence</a>; and the deterioration of their own health or the health of loved ones.</p></div>

    <div class="body-text  "><h3>South Sudan</h3><p>Since the war in Sudan started, more than 1 million people have fled to South Sudan. The border county of Renk, which has seen a surge of approximately 120,000 new arrivals since December 2024, has been significantly impacted. MSF is providing medical services to refugees and returnees and host communities in several regions, including Renk, the Abyei Special Administrative Area, and the capital, Juba.</p><p>In Renk, MSF supports Renk County Hospital, offering pre- and post-operative care for war-related injuries in partnership with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which provides surgical care, runs pediatric services, and operates a cholera treatment unit. MSF has set up 17 additional tents to accommodate the influx of patients.</p><p>MSF also conducts outreach activities at the Gossfami, Girbanat, and Atam informal settlements, which host over 60,000 people facing a severe lack of health care services. MSF initially supplied non-food items like blankets and water containers and continues to conduct outpatient consultations, predominantly treating malaria and diarrhea cases. Our teams also run an ambulance service referring patients to Renk Civil Hospital, provide up to 23,000 liters [over 6,000 gallons] of water daily, and are currently setting up sanitation infrastructure, including latrines and water points.</p><p>On October 28, 2024, the South Sudan Ministry of Health declared a cholera outbreak in Renk County, exacerbated by inadequate sanitation and overcrowded living conditions. The disease spread unusually fast to at least seven of the nation's 10 states. MSF has responded in five states, treating cholera patients and administering vaccinations in areas such as Renk, Malakal, Rubkona, Juba, and Gorom refugee camp, where currently over 12,000 Sudanese refugees are living.</p><p>Despite the increasing number of refugees and returnees, significant gaps remain in the humanitarian response. Water supply and sanitation facilities pose urgent concerns; many communities depend on dwindling rainwater sources, which raises the risk of communal conflict. Moreover, food and shelter shortages persist, with many living in inadequate conditions, such as makeshift tents or under trees, while lacking essential needs. MSF is committed to supporting all affected people in South Sudan, including refugees, returnees, and local communities facing dire circumstances.</p></div>

    <div class="body-text  "><p>MSF has been present in Sudan since 1979, witnessing historic changes and escalating needs in response to the rapid shifts in the country’s political and social dynamics, which in turn impact health needs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our intervention began shortly before the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983-2005), which was fought primarily between the north and south of Sudan and was one of Africa's longest civil wars. MSF was actively involved in providing medical care to war-affected communities dealing with massive displacement, famine, and the outbreak of diseases. With the independence of South Sudan in 2011, MSF continued operations in both countries, adapting to the shifting dynamics of conflict and the division of resources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the war broke out in April 2023, many activities were either stopped or shifted to respond to the emerging needs and emergencies across the country. Some activities continued—in Darfur, for example—thanks to the efforts of our locally hired MSF staff, who continued to work despite the extremely difficult personal and environmental circumstances.&nbsp;</p></div>

Many of the migrants chose to leave their home countries in search of a better life in Lebanon—only to find themselves trapped under the <em>kafala</em> (sponsorship) system, excluded from legal protections afforded to other workers and robbed of their agency. Half are domestic workers, often subjected to mistreatment and abuse in their employers' homes.</p></div>

    <div class="body-text  "><h2>Living under the kafala system</h2><p>Migrant workers come to Lebanon through the kafala<em> </em>system, which has been described by human rights activists and organizations as amounting to “<a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/01/04/lebanons-abusive-kafala-sponsorship-system">modern-day slavery</a>.” Under this system, many migrants are overworked and underpaid—or not paid at all—with no breaks or days off. Those who are domestic workers often face verbal and physical abuse in their employers' homes, with serious implications for their health and well-being. These workers are almost exclusively women.</p><p>Under the kafala system, sponsors often take migrants' legal documents along with their agency as humans. Migrants can be denied their right to communicate with anybody outside of the household, including their family. Leaving the house is not always possible, and they can only return to their home country if their sponsor consents.&nbsp;</p><div class="background-tan text-align-center">"I’m scared to get out of the house. Other than for work, I don’t go anywhere. If I face a problem, this is not my country and my family can’t help me."&nbsp;<br /><em><strong>—&nbsp;Beatrice</strong></em></div><p><a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/focus/global-access-to-medicine" title="Access to medicine and medical care">Access to health care</a> is severely limited for migrants bound by the kafala system, which allows employers to deny workers their right to health care. Even those operating outside the system face difficulty accessing care, as they are frequently turned away from hospitals and primary health care centers for not having legal documents, or simply because they’re not Lebanese. Some avoid seeking health services altogether for fear of being turned away or deported, or because they don't have the money to pay for care. This can worsen and complicate medical conditions.</p><p>While some workers are able to find support within migrant communities, many are left homeless, without legal documents, and in need of urgent assistance. Those seeking to return home might not have the resources to arrange their paperwork or buy a plane ticket. Despite the hardships they face, some choose to stay in Lebanon because they need to feed their families, or simply because they have nowhere to go.</p></div>

    <div class="body-text  "><h2>The dehumanization of domestic workers</h2><p>When migrant workers share their stories with MSF staff, themes of racism and discrimination are prevalent. In Lebanon, the term <em>El-Srilankiyye</em> (Arabic for “The Sri Lankan”) has historically been used to refer to migrant domestic workers—regardless of their actual nationality—reflecting the origin of most workers arriving in the early 2000s. As migration patterns shifted, the term <em>El-Ethiopiyye</em> (“The Ethiopian”) became more common.</p><div class="background-tan text-align-center">"This world doesn’t see us as human."&nbsp;<br /><em><strong>—&nbsp;Tigist*</strong></em></div><p>These labels not only reduce individuals to their nationality but also reinforce stereotypes that people from these backgrounds are inherently domestic workers. More concerning is the implication that such work is degrading, further marginalizing people who take on these essential roles. Their mistreatment and exploitation have been normalized to the point that even the most shocking stories have become recurrent.</p></div>

Migrant workers are often dehumanized, subjected to racism and discrimination, and exposed to physical and sexual abuse. All this has deep repercussions on their psychological well-being.”</p><p>One of the challenges migrants face in Lebanon is the language barrier, which further limits their ability to access health care as they are obliged to sign documents and communicate in Arabic to survive. But at MSF’s clinic, things are done differently.</p><div class="background-tan text-align-center">“For the 15 days I spent in that house, I would wait until everyone was asleep to sneak some bread or an orange. I was living on scraps.”&nbsp;<br /><em><strong>—&nbsp;Makdes*</strong></em></div><p>“We’re one of the rare organizations in Lebanon offering translation for migrants during mental health sessions,” said Saikali. “What makes our clinic special is the presence of community health educators for patients. They are MSF staff from the migrant communities who facilitate patient bonding, build trust, and make sure the patient is properly informed about their health status.”</p></div>

This is not a recent issue, as it’s been happening for a while.”</p><p>One of the biggest challenges MSF teams in Lebanon are facing is referring patients for hospitalization, including for psychiatric emergencies. Organizations with scarce funding might have to stop covering hospitalization for migrants. If these organizations scale down this support, MSF alone would not be able to cover the gap alone, and many people’s needs will go unmet.</p><p><em>*Names have been changed</em></p></div>

Soon after she arrived, her employer sent her to live with their elderly parents and their caregiver. For the three months she lived in that house, the caregiver <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/sexual-and-gender-based-violence" title="Sexual and gender-based violence">sexually harassed her</a>, but no one believed her. Even after she recorded a video of the harassment, the perpetrator was not held accountable and her experience was dismissed. She was then sent to live in her employer’s house along with other migrant workers.</p><p>“My employer would yell at me if I asked her for anything or asked her a question,” said Martha. “She mistreated me, often delaying paying me my salary.

When a mediator tried to convince the employer that Martha was indeed sick, her response was, “She’s under my name [legally], she’s mine, I will take her wherever I want.” By the time Martha was finally taken to a doctor, she was no longer able to walk. She was supposed to go back to the doctor’s clinic for a follow-up, but the employer denied her that right and she became sick again.&nbsp;</p><p>“The house was always guarded; I could not run away,” Martha said. “I told my employer I needed to renew my passport, so she took me to the embassy and I never went back. I’ve been in this shelter for a month now. I want to go back home.”</p><p>Despite the hardships she faced, Martha does not hold a grudge. “I have suffered, yes, but I learned from my experiences. I have not one dime on me, but at least I saved my family from going hungry. No matter what happens, I will always have love in my heart, which is what I like the most about myself.”</p></div>

Two people picked her up from the airport in Beirut, claiming that they’d apply for residency for her, but ended up running away with all her money.</p><p>That’s when the reality hit her: Without a visa to live or work in Lebanon, she would need a sponsor who she'd probably have to live with, and unable to choose the type of work that suited her. The promise of a better life in Lebanon quickly vanished.</p><p>Ahmet started taking odd jobs where she could find them, mainly ironing and dishwashing. Her husband later joined her in Lebanon and found a job at a hotel. Around a year ago, however, he was arrested for not having a valid work permit. He spent four months in jail before being deported to Bangladesh.</p></div>

This past year—living without my husband and through a war—has been very tough for me.”</p><p>"My mind is constantly turning," she added. "I worry about everything.

We don’t have news of many of the people who worked with us and decided to remain with their relatives in the camp after the suspension of our field hospital. We’re horrified by what they have to endure, and extremely worried about them and the hundreds of thousands of people already on the brink of survival in the area.

Such attacks on hospitals and health care workers are completely unacceptable. We are gravely concerned about the devastating impact the closure of medical services will have on already-vulnerable communities, who now face even greater barriers to accessing lifesaving care.”</p><h2>Fear is driving patients away from care</h2><p>As violence drew closer to Ulang on the night of April 13, patients began fleeing the hospital in fear—despite needing medical care. At the time, the hospital had more than 100 patients receiving critical treatment, including trauma care, <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/maternal-health" title="Maternal health">maternity</a> services, and <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/focus/child-health-initiatives" title="Children’s health">pediatric</a> care. While some patients remained in the facility as long as they could, they were ultimately forced to flee when armed men entered the facility and began looting it room by room.</p></div>

    <div class="body-text  "><h2>Deteriorating security affects health care access</h2><p>The attack on the MSF hospital in Ulang is part of a broader pattern of insecurity affecting health care in the area. In January 2025, two clearly marked MSF boats carrying six staff were attacked by armed men while returning to Ulang after delivering medical supplies to Nasir County Hospital. That incident forced MSF to suspend all outreach activities in the region.</p><p>In Ulang, MSF has been operating a secondary health care hospital alongside a network of decentralized primary health care services since 2018. In 2024 alone, MSF teams provided over 10,000 outpatient consultations, admitted 3,284 patients for inpatient care, and assisted with 650 maternal deliveries. Over the years, the 60-bed hospital has served as a critical facility for communities affected by violence, disease outbreaks, and limited access to health care.</p></div>

    <div class="body-text  "><h2>Simultaneous emergencies compound crises</h2><p>Sudan is facing multiple, overlapping health emergencies at the same time. MSF teams have treated over 12,000 patients—including women and children—for trauma injuries directly resulting from violent attacks. During the first week of February 2025, MSF teams in three areas of Sudan—Khartoum, North Darfur, and South Darfur states—treated mass influxes of war-wounded patients. Sudan is also experiencing one of the worst <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/maternal-health" title="Maternal health">maternal</a> and <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/focus/child-health-initiatives" title="Children’s health">child health</a> crises we are seeing anywhere in the world. In October 2024, in two MSF-supported facilities in Nyala, capital of South Darfur, 26 percent of pregnant and breastfeeding women seeking care were acutely malnourished.&nbsp;</p><p>“Outbreaks of <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/measles" title="Measles">measles</a>, <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/cholera" title="Cholera">cholera</a>, and diphtheria are spreading, driven by poor living conditions and disrupted vaccination campaigns,” said Marta Cazorla, MSF emergency coordinator. “<a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/mental-health" title="Mental health">Mental health</a> support and care for survivors of sexual violence remain painfully limited. These compounding crises reflect not just the brutality of the conflict, but the dire consequences of the crumbling public health care system and a failing humanitarian response.”&nbsp;</p><p>Since April 2023, more than 1.7 million people have sought medical consultations at hospitals, health facilities and mobile clinics MSF supports or is working in, and more than 320,000 people were admitted to our emergency wards.</p><p>About 13 million people have been displaced by the conflict, according to the UN—many of them displaced multiple times. Of these, 8.9 million remain displaced inside Sudan, while 3.9 million have crossed into neighboring countries. Many live in overcrowded camps or makeshift shelters, without access to food, water, health care, or a sense of the future. People depend entirely on humanitarian organizations—but organizations are not responding everywhere.&nbsp;</p></div>

    <div class="body-text  "><h2>Health facilities destroyed&nbsp;</h2><p>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 70 percent of health facilities in conflict-affected areas are barely operational or completely closed, leaving millions without access to critical care amid one of the worst humanitarian crises in recent history. Since the war began, MSF has recorded over 80 violent incidents targeting our staff, infrastructure, vehicles, and supplies. Clinics have been looted and destroyed, medicines stolen, and health care workers assaulted, threatened, or killed.&nbsp;</p><p>“Buildings were destroyed, even beds were looted, and medicines ,” said Muhammad Yusuf Ishaq Abdullah, MSF health promotion officer in Tawila, North Darfur, about the state of Tawila’s hospital after being attacked and looted in June 2023. “From afar, it looked like a hospital, but when you entered it, it was a shelter for snakes and grass.”</p><p>These attacks must stop. Medical personnel and facilities are not targets.&nbsp;</p></div>

More border crossings must be opened, and key roads and bridges must be repaired and kept accessible, especially in Darfur, where seasonal flooding isolates communities year after year.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, humanitarian restrictions must be lifted, and unhindered access must be guaranteed.

Without a serious commitment to overcoming the political, financial, logistical, and security barriers that hinder last-mile delivery, countless lives will remain beyond the reach of help.</p><p>The people of Sudan have endured this horror for too long.

    <div class="body-text  "><h2>Consequences of delayed treatment</h2><p>Patients like Volodymyr who have neglected diseases are common in this hospital, which is the closest medical facility to the eastern front line that provides secondary care. It is located at the intersection of three regions with active fighting, and receives a high influx of people seeking medical help.</p><p>People come here from the frontline communities of Donetsk, Dnipropetrovsk, and Zaporizhzhia regions, where the shelling does not stop for even a day. The living conditions there are difficult. Patients often do not have <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/access-medicines" title="Access to medicines">access to medicines</a> and medical care, or to food and hygiene items, spending most of their time hiding in the basements of their homes.</p><p>The most intense fighting continues in the Donetsk region, where the front line remains unstable and shifts rapidly, leaving behind devastated towns and villages with people trapped in them. The current hotspots are near Pokrovsk, Kurakhove, and Chasiv Yar. Hospitals in these areas have had to <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/ukraine-last-civilian-hospital-pokrovsk-forced-evacuate-all-staff" title="Ukraine: Last civilian hospital in Pokrovsk forced to evacuate all staff">evacuate</a> their medical staff and equipment, forcing residents to travel long distances to reach the nearest medical facility. Roads are often littered with remnants of weapons, some of which may still contain unexploded ordnance, making travel extremely dangerous. As a result, many people delay seeking medical help, and their conditions worsen.</p><p>“Once we had a patient with a three-day-old peritonitis [inflammation of the abdomen’s inner wall], so we had to take him to the operating theater immediately,” recalls MSF medical activity manager Dr. Khassan El-Kafarna. “People have limited access to health care, and we see how it affects them. There are lots of patients with exacerbated non-communicable diseases: hypertensive crisis, strokes, and neglected surgical diseases.”</p></div>

Title    : Sybiha: Russia has violated all ten principles of the Helsinki Final Act, it has no place in the OSCE

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Russia poses and will continue to pose an immediate and existential threat to the security of Europe, so it is necessary to update the European security system and reform international law.<br />Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha wrote about this on the social network X, <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-polytics/3982740-sibiga-rosia-porusila-vsi-desat-principiv-gelsinskogo-zaklucnogo-akta-ij-ne-misce-v-obse.html">Ukrinform</a> reports.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>He reminded that this year the Helsinki Final Act turns 50 years old.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“This document, which is fundamental to the European security architecture, begins with a statement of ten principles. A closer look reveals that Russia has violated each of them,” the minister said.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In particular, he stated that by attacking Ukraine, the Russian Federation violated the principle of political independence and territorial integrity of states, the obligation not to threaten or use force against any state, the principles of inviolability of borders, peaceful settlement of disputes, non-interference in internal affairs, human rights and fundamental freedoms, equal rights and self-determination of peoples, cooperation in accordance with the principles and purposes of the UN Charter and fulfillment of obligations under international law.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Having violated all ten fundamental principles of the Helsinki Final Act, Russia has no right to talk about any of its 'legitimate security interests' and has no place in the OSCE. The architecture of European security must be updated with the understanding that Russia poses and will continue to pose an immediate and existential threat to the security of Europe,” Sybiha said.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>He added that these violations also show that the current international system is dysfunctional and unfair.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“International law should be a law, not a declaration. With effective enforcement mechanisms. In this regard, we insist on a broader reform of international humanitarian and criminal law - reform of the enforcement instruments of the Geneva Convention and other measures aimed at improving the effectiveness of the international system,” the Foreign Minister stressed.</p>

Title    : Democrats in U.S. House of Representatives prepare bill to back Ukraine
Published: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:05:00 +0000
Summary  :
<p><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="127" src="https://uatv.ua/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/5351-222x127.jpg" width="222" /></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives introduced a bill on Monday aimed at supporting Ukraine in its war against Russia.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>That is reported by <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-lawmakers-look-boost-ukraine-sanction-russia-sources-say-2025-04-14/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Reuters</a>, <a href="https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-polytics/3982170-democrats-in-us-house-of-representatives-prepare-bill-to-back-ukraine.html">as cited by Ukrinform.</a></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The bill, which is focused on security aid, reconstruction efforts for Ukraine, and imposing tough sanctions on Russia, was introduced by Representative Greg Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>It is noted that the bill, which has not yet been made public, comes two weeks after bipartisan members of the Senate proposed imposing severe sanctions on Russia if it refuses to engage in good-faith peace negotiations with Ukraine.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>According to aides who helped draft the bill, even if the proposal itself does not pass in the Republican-majority House, many of its provisions are likely to be included in any final broad Ukraine aid package.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“This bill obviously will be part of the legislative conversation,” one aide said.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The document consists of three main sections and provides more support for Ukraine than the Senate's version.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The first section reaffirms U.S. support for Ukraine and NATO. It also includes measures to help Ukraine rebuild, including creating the position of a special coordinator for Ukraine reconstruction.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The second section focuses on security assistance for Kyiv, including direct loans and military financing.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The third section proposes strict sanctions and export controls against Russia targeting financial institutions, the oil and mining industries, and Russian officials.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As previously reported, a large bipartisan group of U.S. Senators recently unveiled a proposal for a bill that would introduce both primary and secondary sanctions against Russia, as well as anyone aiding its aggression against Ukraine.</p>

Title    : Significant Progress in Talks with U.S. on Critical Minerals Agreement is Reached, – Economy Ministry of Ukraine
Published: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 13:16:00 +0000

<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>Ukraine’s Deputy Prime Minister and Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko has announced significant progress in negotiations with the United States on an agreement concerning critical minerals.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>She shared the update in a post on Facebook, highlighting a positive step forward with the U.S. toward an economic partnership agreement and the creation of an investment fund for Ukraine’s reconstruction.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>“Our technical teams have worked thoroughly on the agreement — there has been substantial progress. The legal teams have made the right emphasis in the draft. I’m grateful to the negotiators on both sides,” she wrote.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>According to Svyrydenko, there is now an agreement with the American side to record this progress in a memorandum of understanding.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>“We are preparing to finalize the agreement in the near future,” she added.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>While teams will continue working on specific provisions of the agreement, much of the groundwork has already been completed, she noted.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>“The agreement will be subject to ratification by the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine. It will open up opportunities for investment and development in Ukraine, and will also create the conditions for tangible economic growth in both Ukraine and the United States,” Svyrydenko explained.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>Earlier, media reported that the United States had softened its demands for Ukraine to repay the aid it received as part of the negotiations on a minerals deal.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>Previously, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump had reintroduced a requirement in the draft agreement for Ukraine to reimburse all assistance provided since the beginning of Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>On April 11, officials from both countries met to discuss a U.S. proposal for access to Ukraine’s mineral resources. Media described the atmosphere of the meeting as “antagonistic.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>During the technical consultations in Washington, the Ukrainian delegation presented a set of proposals prepared in Kyiv to the U.S. side.</p>

Title    : UK intelligence estimates Russian casualties in 2025

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Russia has likely sustained approximately 138,000 casualties (killed and wounded) in the Russia-Ukraine war so far in 2025.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The UK Ministry of Defense said this in its <a href="https://x.com/DefenceHQ/status/1911707265494642711" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">intelligence update</a> published on social media platform X, <a href="https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3981979-uk-intelligence-estimates-russian-casualties-in-2025.html">according to Ukrinform.</a></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The ministry, citing data from the Ukrainian General Staff, noted that in March 2025, the average daily Russian casualties were approximately 1,300.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This rose from 1,250 in February 2025, but remains below the very high daily rates of nearly 1,600 in late 2024.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>"The rise in casualty rates has continued into early April 2025, and is highly likely reflective of increased Russian attacks along the frontline. Russian forces are likely attempting to rebuild frontline momentum following a period of lower attacks in the opening months of the year," the update said.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>However, the ministry added that despite a relatively static frontline, reported Russian casualties remain significantly higher in 2025 so far than compared to spring 2024, when recorded daily Russian casualty rates were consistently below 1,000.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Since invading Ukraine, Russia has likely sustained more than 920,000 total casualties.</p>

Title    : Yermak urges G7 countries to ramp up pressure on Russia amid ongoing missile attacks

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Head of the Office of the President of Ukraine Andrii Yermak, during an online meeting with national security advisers of the G7 leaders, called for increased pressure on Russia amid its ongoing missile attacks on Ukraine.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This was reported by the <a href="http://www.president.gov.ua/news/andrij-yermak-zaklikav-krayini-g7-posiliti-tisk-na-rosiyu-dl-97217" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Office of the President</a>, <a href="https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-polytics/3982107-yermak-urges-g7-countries-to-ramp-up-pressure-on-russia-amid-ongoing-missile-attacks.html">according to Ukrinform.</a></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Yermak informed the G7 representatives that the ballistic missile strike on Sumy on Sunday, April 13, resulted in 35 deaths and over 100 injuries.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>He stressed that this crime was premeditated, as Russian forces targeted the city center on Palm Sunday.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Yermak also reminded the participants that on April 4, Russia launched ballistic missiles at Kryvyi Rih in Dnipropetrovsk region, killing 19 people, including nine children.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>He pointed out that Russia is using terror as a message: “It’s clear they want to continue this war. It doesn’t matter what they tell you. They will keep trying to conquer Ukraine. And there will be more such terrorist attempts. When dealing with the Russians, we must remember: they are ruthless. Don’t look for goodwill — you won’t find it,” he said.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Yermak thanked the G7 leaders for their response to the missile attack on Sumy.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>All participants condemned the Russian strike and expressed condolences to the victims' families.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“To achieve a real ceasefire and lasting peace, we need to force them, not ask them. There’s only one path: stronger sanctions, more political pressure, greater defensive support for Ukraine, and a fast-track to EU membership. Any other approach gives Russia the chance to fake a peace process while dragging the war on,” Yermak said.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The G7 representatives agreed on the need for continued pressure on Russia, including sanctions, as well as a full ceasefire and humanitarian measures such as the release of prisoners of war and civilians, and the return of illegally deported children.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As reported earlier, following the missile strike by Russian forces on Sumy, Ukraine is preparing an appeal to its partners regarding the urgent need for additional air defense systems.</p>

<p>White House economic advisor Kevin Hassett claims that the United States has made "tremendous progress" in negotiations with the European Union regarding tariffs.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>He said this in an interview with <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6371471447112">Fox News.</a></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>

<p>He became one of the first foreign trade officials to arrive in Washington for urgent talks on tariffs announced by Trump on April 2.</p>

<p>Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump announced a 90-day suspension of the unprecedented tariffs he had introduced against most countries around the world. In response, the EU also postponed its countermeasures against the U.S.</p>

Title    : Ukraine’s path to NATO remains irreversible – Rutte
Published: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 09:15:00 +0000

<p><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="121" src="https://uatv.ua/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/5376-222x121.jpg" width="222" /></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The decision made at the Washington Summit in 2024, affirming Ukraine’s irreversible path to NATO membership, remains in effect.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte reiterated this in an interview with the My-Ukraina (We-Ukraine) TV channel, <a href="https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-polytics/3982570-ukraines-path-to-nato-remains-irreversible-rutte.html">Ukrinform reports.</a></p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Rutte stated that Ukraine's path to NATO is irreversible, emphasizing that this decision was a result of the Washington summit and remains unchanged. He noted that although it had been stated that Ukraine would eventually join NATO, there was never a guarantee that this would be linked to a peace agreement.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>He further stressed that NATO’s objective is to secure lasting peace for Ukraine rather than merely freezing the conflict.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As reported earlier, the Coalition of the Willing, involving Western partners, remains a key component of Ukraine’s security guarantees.</p>

Title    : Russia may simulate successes on front line by May 9 – Austrian expert
Published: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 08:40:00 +0000
Summary  :
<p><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="116" src="https://uatv.ua/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/5344-222x116.jpg" width="222" /></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>By May 9, in order to create the impression of success at the front, Russia may try to advance southwest of Pokrovsk in the direction of the Dnipro region, which is only a few kilometers away from the administrative border of the Russian-occupied areas.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This opinion was expressed in a comment to an <a href="https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3982031-austrian-expert-russia-may-stage-simulated-frontline-successes-until-may-9.html">Ukrinform</a> correspondent by the head of the Institute for Officer Training at the Theresian Military Academy, Colonel Markus Reisner of the Austrian Armed Forces.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“At the moment, I am looking at the development of the situation on the frontline with a bit of an eye on May 9, the “Victory Day”, when&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/tag-rosia" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Russia</a>&nbsp;traditionally wants to demonstrate some “achievements”. I believe that Pokrovsk itself is now seen as a somewhat secondary area. The troops that were liberated in the Kursk direction are now regrouping, also taking into account Ukrainian actions in the Belgorod direction. It is likely that Russia will try to move west of Pokrovsk, as it is only about 4 km to the border with Dnipropetrovsk oblast. For the average citizen, including Russians, the real picture of the front is unclear, but if they read in a newspaper that Russian troops are already in the Dnipro region, it will have an informational impact,” the expert noted.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In his opinion, dominance in the information space is one of the key aspects of warfare.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>According to the Austrian military expert, Russia holds the strategic initiative at the front, trying to put pressure on the Ukrainian Defense Forces in various parts of the broad front and forcing them to respond in certain places. At the same time, he noted Ukraine's attempts to regain the initiative, such as in the case of the counteroffensive in the Kursk region. The Ukrainian offensive in Kursk region forced the Russians to deploy their elite military units, including unmanned aerial vehicles, which “led to a decrease in the intensity of the Russian offensive in Donbas,” Reisner said.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Noting the determination and resilience of the Ukrainian Defense Forces, which at the beginning of the full-scale invasion stopped the Russian advance using their own resources, including a large number of Soviet-made armored vehicles, the expert pointed out that the situation at the front remains very difficult. This is largely due to the fact that Western military assistance has been, in his words, “belated, fragmented, and often politically limited.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Against the backdrop of this scattered and slow support for Ukraine from Europe, the expert noted the resource advantage of the Russian Federation, which was able to stabilize and increase military production, including through the support of its allies. He pointed out that “Russia is not fighting the war alone.” The DPRK has supplied millions of artillery shells, Iran has provided Moscow with not only thousands of drones but also technology, and China and India are actually financing the Russian war by purchasing resources on favorable terms.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“North Korea, a country that we believe is ruled by a madman, has supplied 3 million artillery shells twice in a row, last year and the year before. The Russians produced between 2.5 and 3 million artillery shells during the same period, which amounts to a total of 12 million artillery shells. What have we done during this time? We delivered 1.6 million to the Ukrainians last year and 1.3 million the year before that,” the Austrian colonel compared the allies' assistance to Ukraine and Russia with shells.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>According to him, although technically and economically Europe is capable of more, the main barrier is not industrial capacity, but political will, public perception and willingness to allocate significant funds.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As reported by Ukrinform,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-ato/3981775-na-fronti-za-dobu-vidbulosa-158-boezitknen.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">158 combat clashes between the Ukrainian Defense Forces and Russian invaders were recorded at the front yesterday</a>, April 13.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>According to the Deep State map, the positions seized by the Russians southwest of Pokrovsk, whose assault the Ukrainian Defense Forces managed to thwart despite months of occupation efforts, are located approximately 5 kilometers from the administrative border of the Dnipro region.</p>

Title    : U.S. Eases Stance on Ukraine Aid Repayment in Minerals Deal, – Bloomberg
Published: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 08:06:00 +0000
Summary  :
<p><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="127" src="https://uatv.ua/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/4771-222x127.png" width="222" /></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>The United States has softened its demands for Ukraine to repay aid as part of negotiations over a minerals agreement, <em><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-16/us-softens-calls-for-ukraine-to-pay-back-aid-in-minerals-deal-talks?srnd=homepage-europe&amp;fbclid=IwY2xjawJsJ31leHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHpIm6dmhtNf3FaJNKPN9HHO4gA2jOKirGtEusuzgAFHGZrdLmRFXF9zi-Xd-_aem_5_c3qnSCDngrbgLLG61aTQ">Bloomberg</a></em> reported, citing informed sources.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>According to individuals familiar with the talks, the U.S. appears to have relaxed its repayment requirements in the ongoing negotiations over an economic agreement between the two countries.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>Following a round of talks in Washington last week, the administration of President Donald Trump lowered its estimate of the aid provided to Ukraine since Russia’s full-scale invasion from $300 billion to approximately $100 billion. This figure is now closer to Ukraine’s own estimate of over $90 billion.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>The Ukrainian government declined to comment on the situation until the agreement is signed. The White House and U.S. Treasury Department also did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>However, a spokesperson for the U.S. Treasury said the technical-level talks had been highly productive and that both sides are hopeful the negotiations can be concluded swiftly.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>One of the sources said that the technical team meetings on Friday and Saturday were constructive. Nevertheless, the U.S. still views the agreement as an opportunity to recoup its spending on Ukraine through future profits from a dedicated fund—the size of which remains unspecified in the latest draft.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>Sources also revealed that the Trump administration is reluctant to commit to future investments in the fund and is deferring this issue for later discussion. Instead, Washington insists that its past spending on the war in Ukraine should be considered its contribution to the fund.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>Ukrainian negotiators have reportedly found it difficult to dissuade their U.S. counterparts from this approach, which underpins some of the most stringent American demands.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>One source noted that legal teams will continue working remotely this week to finalize the draft agreement as soon as possible.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>A task for Kyiv ahead of the next online meeting this week is to provide details of specific projects that could be implemented under the agreement.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>Earlier, the Trump administration had reintroduced into the draft agreement a requirement for Ukraine to reimburse all assistance provided by the U.S. since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>On April 11, U.S. and Ukrainian officials met to discuss a U.S. proposal for access to Ukraine’s mineral resources. Media reports described the atmosphere of the meeting as “antagonistic.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>During those technical consultations in Washington, the Ukrainian delegation submitted its proposals prepared in Kyiv to the American side.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>On April 15, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that the recent negotiations between the Ukrainian and American teams on the minerals agreement were positive.</p>

Published: Wed, 16 Apr 2025 14:59:49 +0300
Summary  :
<p>Birth rates in Russia today are among the lowest in the country’s history. In their efforts to reverse the demographic decline, authorities have turned to symbolic but largely ineffective measures — from restricting abortion access to banning “childfree propaganda” and the “LGBT movement.” And they haven't stopped there: officials and lawmakers regularly float new proposals that they believe will bring the birthrate back into the green. One such idea was put forward on April 14, 2025, when a lawmaker proposed shortening the workday for women. “We’re facing the question of how to raise the birthrate, but when is a young woman supposed to have time for a personal life, if she’s spending all day at work, and then coming home tired?” said State Duma Deputy Igor Antropenko. Meduza has compiled a list of other, equally bizarre proposals from Russian officials for solving the country's population crisis.<p>

Title    : 'It’s all about raw, exaggerated emotion'. How Russia's propaganda shows went from demonizing America to praising Trump without blinking
Published: Mon, 14 Apr 2025 18:53:40 +0300
Summary  :
<p>Three years into the full-scale war in Ukraine, the Kremlin’s propaganda machine is still hard at work telling Russians that the invasion is justified, Ukraine and the West are to blame, and Vladimir Putin is acting in their best interests. But U.S. President Donald Trump’s first two months back in office have complicated this narrative. His efforts to rebuild ties with Moscow have led Russian state media and officials to swing from cursing the U.S. over the war to praising its president for his kind words about Putin and his dismantling of institutions like USAID. To unpack how Russian propagandists have handled this about-face, the independent outlet Cherta spoke with journalist Ilya Shepelin, who tracks pro-Kremlin media and formerly hosted the show “Fake News” on TV Rain.

<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has claimed he’s ready for peace talks with Ukraine — though not on “the basis of Kyiv’s demands.” But the numbers at home tell a different story. Recruitment efforts in Russian regions are surging, with local administrations boosting sign-on bonuses and pushing contracts on anyone who walks into an enlistment office, according to a new report from Sibir.Realii, the Siberian branch of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s Russian service. At the same time, sources told the outlet that the surge may be driven in part by the peace talks themselves, as some people hope to collect military payouts before the government has time to send them to the front. Meduza shares an abridged English-language version of their findings.<p>

Title    : Statement on ISW Methodology
Published: Fri, 05 May 2023 01:23:40 +0000
Summary  :
<div class="field field-name-field-cover-image field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><img alt="" height="125" src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/styles/square_thumbnail/public/ISW%20LOGO%202_153.jpg?itok=kxannOZ8" width="125" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p align="center" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Statement on ISW Methodology</strong></p>
<p align="center" style="text-align: left;"><strong>May 4, 2023</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) welcomes robust and rigorous debate on the issues ISW covers and is especially grateful for the interaction with and feedback from those who engage seriously with the methodological challenges of performing intelligence from publicly available information. ISW’s entire team shares a passion for sound tradecraft and a desire to engage openly regarding our methodology, including our analytic and forecasting successes as well as our limitations. We seek to raise the general level of discussion of national security and especially military issues and are grateful for the aid of all who contribute to that effort.</p>
<p>A few key takeaways regarding ISW’s approach can help inform readers about ISW’s work and establish constructive topics for engagement:</p>
<ul><li>ISW applies rigorous intelligence tradecraft that reflects best practices drawn from the US intelligence community. ISW uses technical language from the military and intelligence community in its products in order to maintain the rigor of its tradecraft and communicate with the greatest possible precision.</li>
<li>ISW’s extensive, daily collection and analysis provides a highly tested baseline of existing patterns, enabling relatively fast identification of anomalies and inflections. ISW’s ability to make a judgment on a given piece of data is informed by its months of prior study.</li>
<li>ISW has applied its proven methodology for analyzing conflicts for over 15 years. ISW’s Ukraine work applies the same tradecraft ISW has used to analyze and map other wars, including ISW’s extensive coverage of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.</li>
<li>ISW is fully independent of the US and foreign governments, takes no money from these entities, and is committed to its independence as a key source of objectivity.</li>
<li>ISW aims to inform, not convince, audiences and makes available the sourcing of each product to ensure readers can engage directly with the underlying data and form their own conclusions, especially amidst disinformation campaigns. ISW uses no classified or privileged information in its products.</li>
<li>ISW analysts interpret available data to form assessments – they do not simply report facts. ISW explicitly states its specific confidence level in each assessment whenever applicable and encourages our readers to include it when reporting our assessments in order to minimize the risk of misinterpretation. ISW will publish low-confidence assessments if its analysts judge the issue being assessed to be sufficiently important, timely, or risky to warrant a flag even as ISW continues to evaluate new information.</li>
<li>ISW innovates new ways of collecting, analyzing, and visualizing public data. ISW established a new geospatial program to scale its mapping effort after the Russian invasion and to drive mapping innovation, which was generously enabled by the Dr. Jack London Geospatial Fund.</li>
</ul><p>ISW is committed to providing accurate, granular, and timely intelligence from open sources on threats to US national security interests, including Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine. The purpose of ISW’s work is to inform US and allied decision-makers and to educate public audiences regarding these threats. ISW products help to visualize and explain fast-moving conflicts as well as to interpret their trajectory and significance.<strong> ISW’s publication series on the war in Ukraine is an exemplar of ISW’s institutional values and methodology. As such, it is a useful means of understanding ISW’s approach to intelligence analysis.</strong></p>
<p>ISW applies industry-leading tradecraft. ISW’s analytic program trains and applies intelligence methodology that emphasizes source evaluation and characterization, structured analytical techniques, and other foundational principles. Retired members of the intelligence community have informed this tradecraft over many years and ISW welcomes engagement with current intelligence experts regarding ISW’s methodologies. ISW extends this tradecraft into its written product. ISW uses military and intelligence technical language and concepts with precision not only to communicate within a framework that US and allied governments can easily interpret but also, more importantly, to maintain the rigor and discipline of ISW’s analysis even in external communication.</p>
<p><strong>Independence and transparency are core ISW values and are applied to all ISW products.</strong> ISW accepts no US or foreign government money and uses no classified material from any source to produce our analysis. ISW’s independence is a critical enabler of its objectivity. ISW also aims to demonstrate what is possible to achieve in the public domain through the careful application of rigorous tradecraft, even though it is often more difficult than alternative methods. The proven utility of ISW’s products to US and allied governments demonstrates the value of ISW’s approach. ISW’s analytic program is attractive to both aspiring and former members of the intelligence community for this reason.</p>
<p><strong>ISW’s commitment to informing audiences – not convincing them – is demonstrated by ISW’s extensive sharing of its sourcing.</strong> ISW makes available extensive footnotes detailing the evidence used to inform each assessment and has done so for Ukraine since Russia’s current invasion began in February 2022. The investment in this level of evidence-sharing reflects ISW’s commitment to ensuring that readers can form their own judgments on the basis of the evidence and ISW’s reasoning and do not need to take ISW’s word for anything. ISW also analyzes the various information operations directed at and interacting with the war in Ukraine and makes its sourcing available to provide transparency into ISW’s own conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>ISW is not a news organization, however.</strong> <strong>ISW products do not simply report facts but rather <span style="text-decoration: underline;">interpret</span> available data to form assessments regarding what is occurring, has occurred, and could occur and the implications.</strong> Understanding the distinction between fact and assessment is critical for responsibly using ISW products. Assessments can be wrong. In fact, if an analyst is never wrong it is typically a sign that the analyst is doing more reporting than assessing. ISW analysts make calls about what they are seeing and its significance on the basis of data which is invariably incomplete and often contradictory. That data includes but is not limited to the data layers behind ISW’s Ukraine map. ISW analysts also form and continually revise strategic assessments of key actors’ intent, decision-making, capacity, and other factors. This holistic approach is intensive and comprises an analytic backend that is less visible than ISW’s maps but no less vital. ISW’s assessments are sometimes wrong, of course. Whenever ISW concludes that it has made a mistake it publishes a formal correction.</p>
<p>Moreover, analytically sound mapping of war itself requires more than mere data aggregation, as maps are also analytic judgments in visual form. More information on ISW’s mapping methodology is available <a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Cartographical%20Methodology%20Explanation%20ISW%20CTP%202022.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>ISW explicitly states its specific confidence level whenever applicable and encourages our readers to include it when reporting our assessments in order to minimize the risk of misinterpretation.</strong> ISW does not refrain from publishing low-confidence assessments, which often distinguishes ISW from other organizations. Instead, ISW will publish at low confidence if its analysts judge the issue being assessed to be sufficiently important, timely, or risky to warrant a flag, which ISW then caveats as necessary and then re-evaluates as new information emerges. This practice enables early warning that provides a valuable means of scoping the aperture of decision-makers even as the situation develops. It is particularly important amidst highly contested information environments like the one in Ukraine.</p>
<p>ISW’s diligence in performing daily analysis of the available data regarding the war in Ukraine is a powerful enabler of ISW’s accuracy. ISW’s teams maintain a constant stare at not only the battlespace but also the information environment. This approach often enables analysts to make relatively fast judgments of new information based on the established patterns ISW monitors closely. It also enables rapid detection of change, anomalies, and inflections which is a key marker of ISW’s unique success in understanding and explaining the war in Ukraine and other conflicts. It has been a critical enabler of ISW’s forecasting accuracy for many years. For example, ISW <a href="https://www.iswresearch.org/2013/11/further-indications-of-al-qaedas.html">warned</a> that ISIS would attempt to seize territorial control in Iraq and that Mosul was vulnerable seven months before ISIS launched its blitz offensive in June 2014. </p>
<p><strong>ISW has applied this proven methodology for analyzing conflicts for over 15 years.</strong> ISW products, including detailed maps, have consistently been utilized by decision-makers and news organizations covering fast-moving and complex national security challenges because of their accuracy and consistency. ISW’s maps of ISIS control in Iraq and Syria provided the leading source of insight and visualization of the war against ISIS after Mosul’s fall and were broadcast widely by international media organizations and leveraged <a href="https://twitter.com/CENTCOM/status/852957314990649345?lang=en">directly</a> by US Central Command in public communications to explain the status of the fight. ISW has extensively mapped the war in Syria, produced detailed maps of the war in Afghanistan at key stages, and has mapped the fight in Ukraine in various ways since the Russians first invaded in 2014. </p>
<p><strong>ISW continues to innovate new ways of collecting, analyzing, and visualizing public data in order to answer intelligence questions that provide US and allied decision-makers with timely and reliable information.</strong> New social media platforms, commercially available data, censorship and disinformation efforts, automation tools and other software all pose new and interesting analytic challenges and opportunities for studying conflict. ISW routinely grapples with these and other opportunities to enhance our tradecraft and reach new insight.</p>
<p><strong>ISW scaled up its mapping effort to meet the demands posed by the Ukraine war in 2022 and established a new geospatial program at ISW, generously enabled by the Dr. Jack London Geospatial Fund.</strong> ISW’s Geospatial team is now a discrete entity that works in support of ISW’s analytic team, providing granular tracking and visualization of the war that informs the assessments ISW analysts produce. This configuration – a mapping team in support of an analytic team – represents a consolidation of ISW’s traditional approach to analyzing conflicts and will enable ISW to continue to achieve greater scale by applying this tradecraft to new portfolios, including China. It also enables ISW’s ongoing innovation of new mapping approaches.</p>
<p>ISW is extraordinarily proud of what its dedicated team has achieved in covering the war in Ukraine for over 430 days. ISW remains grateful to every reader as well as to our generous supporters who enable our work. We also appreciate the hard work of the many other responsible organizations and experts who are adding important insights to the public debate and discussion. ISW’s teams are available, as ever, for inquiries into ISW’s methodology or regarding its products and can be reached via <a href="mailto:press@understandingwar.org">press@understandingwar.org</a>. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Key Takeaway:</em></strong><em> ISIS has orchestrated an annual campaign of intensified attacks around the Islamic holy month of Ramadan since 2012, first in Iraq and then globally. It has sustained this recurring surge in its global operations every year despite its concurrent territorial losses in Iraq and Syria. ISIS’s latest Ramadan campaign began in late April 2019, two weeks before the start of Ramadan on May 5. ISIS has thus far declared a new province in Central Africa, conducted a devastating attack in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday, and launched rare attacks in Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh. ISIS Emir Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi also released his first video statement since his declaration of the Caliphate in 2014, emphasizing his survival, foreshadowing upcoming campaigns, and shaping the future trajectory of ISIS. ISIS is likely to continue demonstrating its global reach by conducting additional major attacks during this upcoming Ramadan in order to offset its loss of core terrain and maintain its image as the world’s deadliest terror organization.</em></p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><strong>Key Takeaway: </strong>Growing Turkish-Russian military cooperation in Syria is a dangerous sign of a wider <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-russia-hold-joint-naval-drill-in-black-sea-141754">shift</a> to a <a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-buying-russian-s-400s-a-done-deal-erdogan-141708">closer</a> strategic relationship between Turkey and Russia. Russia gave Turkey permission to fly air sorties into Northern Syria as part of an agreement for <a href="https://www.dailysabah.com/war-on-terror/2019/03/08/turkey-russia-patrols-in-syrias-idlib-will-be-important-step-for-lasting-ceasefire-minister-says">joint military patrols</a> along the frontlines in Greater Idlib Province. The Turkish Armed Forces <a href="https://www.trthaber.com/haber/turkiye/tel-tokanda-turk-askerine-sevgi-gosterisi-407747.html">began</a> joint frontline patrols with pro-regime forces on March 8 with accompanying <a href="file://C:/Users/Kozak/Downloads/Enab%20Baladi">overflights</a> by the Turkish Air Force. The Turkish-Russian agreement in Idlib Province demonstrates that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is failing in his attempts to spoil the de-escalation zone in Northern Syria brokered by Russia, Iran, and Turkey in 2017. Turkey will likely soon begin independent joint patrols with the Russian Armed Forces. Turkey and Russia <a href="https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/282027">began</a> joint patrols of a separate area near Tel Rifaat north of Aleppo City on February 14. Turkey’s deepening relationship with Russia in Syria decreases the likelihood that the U.S. will reach a negotiated <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-gives-european-allies-friday-deadline-to-sign-on-to-syria-proposal-11551995825">agreement</a> with Turkey over the status of <a href="http://iswresearch.blogspot.com/2019/03/disposition-of-adversary-and-friendly.html">Eastern Syria</a>. Russia intends to use its engagement with Turkey in Western Syria to set conditions to cooperate with Turkey against the U.S.-Led Coalition and its partnered Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in Eastern Syria.  ISW is closely following the evolving situation in Idlib Province and will provide further updates as necessary.</p>

These actors nonetheless still have options that could lead to the defeat or expulsion of U.S. forces. The residual U.S. forces will operate at Al-Tanf on the Syrian-Jordanian Border as well as in Northern and Eastern Syria across the Euphrates River. The garrison at Al-Tanf is relatively defensible with secure supply lines to Jordan as well as a limited tactical requirement to defend the base and a surrounding fifty-five kilometer exclusion zone, which includes the Rukban IDP Camp. The U.S. is significantly more vulnerable east of the Euphrates River. Iran, Assad, and Russia are building up forces west of the Euphrates River and using outreach to local tribes to gain footholds on its eastern bank. Even a limited drawdown by the U.S. will create security gaps east of the Euphrates River that could be exploited by Iran, Assad, and Russia.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Map Methodology: </em></strong>This graphic depicts the disposition of both adversary and partnered forces deployed at key infrastructure locations and urban centers in Eastern Syria and Western Iraq.

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><span style="font-size: 13.008px;">ISIS’s post-Caliphate insurgency in Iraq is accelerating faster than efforts to prevent it by the U.S. Anti-ISIS Coalition. ISIS is re-establishing capable insurgent networks in multiple historical strongholds and linking them together, setting the conditions for future offensive operations against the Government of Iraq. The U.S. and its partners should not view the current relative security in Baghdad as confirmation of the defeat of ISIS. The U.S. Anti-ISIS Coalition’s strategy to enable Iraq to “independently manage” an insurgency through intelligence support and other building partner capacity efforts will likely fail to prevent ISIS from regaining momentum based on its current trajectory in Iraq.</span></p>

Title    : Russia in Review: Russia's Influence Grows After Moldovan Elections
Published: Wed, 06 Mar 2019 05:00:00 +0000
Summary  :
<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><img src="https://files.constantcontact.com/c9ccf499301/d7f25d44-7d67-446d-8201-7553a9322dcd.png" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Kremlin is successfully increasing its political influence in Moldova. The pro-Kremlin Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova (PRSM) won the largest share in the February 24 Moldovan Parliamentary Elections. However, Moldova will likely be forced to call new elections within the next forty-five days due to continued deadlock in government-formation negotiations. Russia will likely bolster its disinformation campaign over the next six weeks in order to set conditions ahead of a new vote. Pro-Kremlin Moldovan President Igor Dodon will also likely continue to shape the information space and stress the need for a strategic alliance with Russia rather than the EU in order to ensure a decisive victory for his PSRM. The U.S. should engage diplomatically and work with favorable political parties in order to counter Russia’s agenda in Moldova.</p>

Title    : Navigating the U.S.-Turkey Relationship Beyond the Quagmire
Published: Wed, 25 Jul 2018 04:00:00 +0000
Summary  :
<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p align="center" style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="font-size: 13.008px;"><em>Key Takeaway</em></strong><em style="font-size: 13.008px;">: The U.S. needs Turkey as an active partner despite its slide into authoritarianism under Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The U.S. should adopt an interest-based approach towards Turkey that shapes its behavior in line with shared strategic objectives such as reversing the gains of Iran and Russia in the Middle East.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The U.S. needs Turkey to contribute actively as an ally in NATO. </strong>The U.S. and NATO face an <a href="http://iswresearch.blogspot.com/2018/07/hungary-risks-nato-unity-on-ukraine.html">increasingly</a> <a href="http://iswresearch.blogspot.com/2018/07/putin-poised-for-easy-victory-ahead-of.html">aggressive</a> Russia in the Middle East and Europe.<strong> </strong>Turkey plays an integral role in countering this threat. It dominates the Turkish Straits connecting the Black Sea to the Eastern Mediterranean. It provides a strategically-positioned platform on the southern flank of NATO from which to exert influence in the Middle East and Black Sea. It also maintains the second-largest available combat force in NATO. The U.S. and NATO already operate a number of critical military installations across Turkey including Incirlik Airbase.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Turkey is nonetheless the largest vulnerability to NATO’s cohesion.</strong> Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan <a href="http://iswresearch.blogspot.com/2018/06/the-collapse-of-turkeys-democracy.html">cemented</a> his own authoritarian rule in the 2018 Turkish General Elections. His new regime is pursuing self-serving policies that undermine the U.S. and NATO. Erdogan is <a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/04/trump-syria-withdrawal-iran-turkey-russia.html">willing to align</a> with Russia and Iran against the U.S. Anti-ISIS Coalition. He has repeatedly fueled <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-migrants-eu/eu-summit-to-focus-on-lowering-mediterranean-immigration-idUSKBN1JL2PJ">diplomatic rifts</a> with the U.S. and EU. He has conducted <a href="http://iswresearch.blogspot.com/2018/01/syrias-war-after-isis-begins-as-turkey.html">military operations</a> <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2018/03/05/pentagon-operations-against-isis-in-eastern-syria-paused/">targeting</a> the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) - the principal ground partner of the U.S. Anti-ISIS Coalition in Syria. His <a href="http://iswresearch.blogspot.com/2018/03/turkey-threatens-new-attacks-in-syria.html">interventions</a> (and <em>de facto</em> territorial annexations) in Iraq and Syria undermine the ability of the U.S. and NATO to credibly condemn similar acts of aggression by Russia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The U.S. should commit to a smarter interest-based approach that compels greater cooperation from Turkey. </strong>The U.S. and Turkey are mired in tactical negotiations that fail to address their wider <a href="http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/PLANEX%20Report%202%20FINALFINAL.pdf">strategic divergences</a> or repair the damage from years of <a href="http://iswresearch.blogspot.com/2017/11/turkeys-silent-al-qaeda-partner-in-syria.html">opposing</a> <a href="http://iswresearch.blogspot.com/2017/05/turkey-divide.html">policy</a> <a href="http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/The%20Pitfalls%20of%20Relying%20on%20Kurdish%20Forces%20to%20Counter%20ISIS.pdf">choices</a> in Iraq and Syria. The Trump Administration has engaged to resolve discrete challenges with Turkey such as the status of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/04/world/middleeast/turkey-syria-kurds-manbij.html">contested town</a> of Manbij in Northern Syria and the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-works-to-ease-tensions-with-turkey-to-secure-pastors-release-1522852192">arbitrary detention</a> of U.S. Pastor Andrew Brunson. These talks are insufficient to mend the relationship absent a more fundamental realignment between the U.S. and Turkey. The U.S. must refocus on areas of shared interest with Turkey following the reelection of an emboldened Erdogan.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li><em style="font-size: 13.008px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Counter-Terrorism</span></em><em style="font-size: 13.008px;">:</em><span style="font-size: 13.008px;"> The U.S. and Turkey can find common ground against designated terrorist groups such as ISIS, al Qaeda, and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). All three groups threaten the long-term stability of Turkey. The U.S. could offer </span><a href="http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-us-to-talk-on-pkk-fight-in-july-fm-133230" style="font-size: 13.008px;">military and intelligence support</a><span style="font-size: 13.008px;"> against the PKK in Turkey and Iraq. The U.S. should also actively limit the influence of the PKK-linked Syrian Kurdish YPG within the SDF. These reforms are independently valuable as a means to address grievances among local Sunni Arabs that could fuel a renewed insurgency against the U.S. Anti-ISIS Coalition. Turkey must in turn cease its </span><a href="http://iswresearch.blogspot.com/2018/02/the-al-qaeda-blind-spot-for-us-approach.html" style="font-size: 13.008px;">cooperation</a><span style="font-size: 13.008px;"> with al Qaeda in Syria and instead engage actively in counter-terrorism operations against al Qaeda and other </span><a href="https://www.criticalthreats.org/analysis/americas-real-enemy-the-salafi-jihadi-movement" style="font-size: 13.008px;">Salafi-Jihadist Groups</a><span style="font-size: 13.008px;">. Turkey must also halt cross-border operations against the SDF that disrupt the Anti-ISIS Campaign in Syria.</span></li>
</ul><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li><em style="font-size: 13.008px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Regional Stability</span></em><em style="font-size: 13.008px;">:</em><strong style="font-size: 13.008px;"> </strong><span style="font-size: 13.008px;">The U.S. and Turkey both aim to contain and ultimately resolve the crises in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. and Turkey </span><a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/syria/2018-07-11/dont-get-out-syria" style="font-size: 13.008px;">could</a> <a href="http://thehill.com/opinion/international/374226-tamping-down-the-crisis-in-turkey" style="font-size: 13.008px;">cooperate</a><span style="font-size: 13.008px;"> to build mutually-acceptable local governance and security structures in both countries that exclude Iran as well as Salafi-Jihadist Groups. The U.S. should revisit its regional strategy to incorporate Turkey as a productive contributor - rather than a reluctant </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/08/29/europe/turkey-airstrikes/index.html" style="font-size: 13.008px;">late addition</a><span style="font-size: 13.008px;"> - to the U.S. Anti-ISIS Campaign. Turkey must in turn limit its unilateral interventions against the PKK in Iraq and Syria and curb its covert support for local actors linked to Salafi-Jihadist Groups.</span></li>

Turkey must freeze its </span><a href="" style="font-size: 13.008px;">purchase</a><span style="font-size: 13.008px;"> of the Russian S-400 Surface-to-Air Missile System. The U.S. in turn should sustain its bilateral security partnership with Turkey including joint military exercises and the sale of key capabilities such as advanced </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-airshow-patriot/u-s-state-department-in-talks-with-turkey-to-sell-patriot-system-idUSKBN1K61LH" style="font-size: 13.008px;">air defense systems</a><span style="font-size: 13.008px;"> and the </span><a href="https://www.defensenews.com/smr/nato-priorities/2018/06/21/turkey-gets-first-f-35-as-congress-put-pressure-on-pentagon-to-stop-future-deliveries/" style="font-size: 13.008px;">F-35</a><span style="font-size: 13.008px;">. Turkey should also be encouraged to limit its diplomatic cooperation with Russia and Iran in the Astana Process on Syria.</span></li>
</ul><ul style="text-align: justify;"><li><em style="font-size: 13.008px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Responsible Governance in Turkey</span></em><em style="font-size: 13.008px;">:</em><strong style="font-size: 13.008px;"> </strong><span style="font-size: 13.008px;">The U.S. still holds a stake in the long-term economic and political durability of Turkey despite the reelection of Erdogan. The U.S. should promote reforms or trade agreements that create a positive investment market in Turkey without rewarding economic mismanagement under Erdogan. The U.S. also must not shy away from enforcing minimal standards of behavior on Turkey. Turkey must be pressed to halt its use of ‘</span><a href="http://www.defenddemocracy.org/content/uploads/documents/REPORT_Erdogan_Hostages.pdf" style="font-size: 13.008px;">hostage diplomacy</a><span style="font-size: 13.008px;">’ and release </span><a href="https://www.csce.gov/international-impact/press-and-media/press-releases/helsinki-commission-leaders-troubled-continued" style="font-size: 13.008px;">detained</a><span style="font-size: 13.008px;"> political prisoners such as U.S. Pastor Andrew Brunson. The U.S. must continue to promote a return to rule of law in Turkey that includes an independent judiciary and other checks on the power of Erdogan.</span></li>
</ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The U.S. can manage its relationship with Turkey without capitulating to Erdogan. </strong>The U.S. and Turkey both need one another to confront their mutual adversaries in the Middle East and Europe. This fact remains true despite the unacceptable growth of authoritarianism under Erdogan. There is no quick policy fix to resolve the tensions between the U.S. and Turkey. The U.S. could nonetheless use an incremental and interest-based approach focused on clear areas of strategic convergence in order to protect its long-term alliance with a post-Erdogan Turkey.</p>

Large numbers of rank-and-file militants expressed their support for peace during unprecedented joint celebrations alongside Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) during a nationwide ceasefire for Eid al-Fitr on June 15 - 17. The ceasefire’s events exposed rifts amongst Taliban leadership concerning reconciliation. The U.S. and the Government of Afghanistan could exploit these apparent rifts in order to advance their strategic goal of a negotiated settlement with the Taliban. The new momentum towards peace could nonetheless generate additional pressure for the withdrawal of the U.S. from Afghanistan amidst the scheduled 2018 Afghan Parliamentary Elections.<strong> </strong>ISIS - Wilayat Khorasan could also exploit these rifts in to bolster its recruitment of hardline Taliban militants and expand its operations in Afghanistan.</span></p>

<p>Within hours of taking office, President Donald Trump declared an emergency on the U.S.-Mexico border, giving him authority to unilaterally spend billions on immigration enforcement and wall construction. He has since <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/02/11/white-house-congress-border-funding-reconciliation">reportedly urged Congress</a> to authorize an additional $175 billion for border security, far exceeding what was spent during his first term.</p>

<p>In the coming months, border towns in Texas and Arizona will receive more grants to fund and equip police patrols. New wall construction projects will fill border communities with workers who eat at restaurants, shop in stores and rent space in RV parks. And National Guard deployments will add to local economies.</p>

<p>But if the president asked Sandra Fuentes what the biggest need in her community on the Texas-Mexico border is, the answer would be safe drinking water, not more border security. And if Trump put the same question to Jose Grijalva, the Arizona mayor would say a hospital for his border city, which has struggled without one for a decade.</p>

<p>Although billions of state and federal dollars flow into the majority-Latino communities along the nearly 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border, many remain among the poorest places in the nation. In many towns, unemployment is significantly higher and income much lower than their interior counterparts, with limited access to health care, underfunded infrastructure and lagging educational attainment. Security walls are erected next to neighborhoods without running water, and National Guard units deploy to towns without paved roads and hospitals. </p>

<p>By some estimates, about 30,000 border residents in Texas lack access to reliable drinking water, among more than a million statewide. For 205,000 people living along Arizona’s border with Mexico, the nearest full-service hospital is hours away.</p>

<p>Such struggles aren’t confined to the border. But the region offers perhaps the most striking disparity between the size of federal and state governments’ investment there and how little it’s reflected in the quality of life of residents.</p>

<p>“The border security issue takes up all the oxygen and a lot of the resources in the room,” said state Rep. Mary González, a Democrat from El Paso County who has sponsored bills to address water needs. “It leaves very little space for all the other priorities, specifically water and wastewater infrastructure, because most people don’t understand what it’s like turning your faucet and there’ll be no water.”</p>

<p>Here’s how residents in two border towns, Del Rio, Texas, and Douglas, Arizona, experience living in places where the government always seems ready to spend on border security while stubborn obstacles to their communities’ well-being remain.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            Nearly a fifth of the nearly 50,000 residents in Val Verde County, Texas, live in poverty, compared with the state’s 14% average.
    
    
    
    

    

        
    
                    

<p>When Cierra Flores gives her daughter a bath at their home in Del Rio, she has to keep a close eye on the water level of the outdoor tank that supplies her house. Like any 6-year-old, her daughter likes to play in the running water. But Flores doesn’t have the luxury of leaving the tap open. When the tank runs dry, the household is out of water. That means not washing dishes, doing laundry or flushing the toilet until the trip can be made to get more water.</p>

<p>Flores lives on a ranch in Escondido Estates, a neighborhood where many residents have gone decades without running water. Flores’ family has a well on their property. But during the summer and prolonged droughts, as the region is now experiencing, their well runs dry.</p>

<p>At those times, the family relies on a neighbor who has a more dependable well and is willing to sell water. Flores’ husband makes hourlong trips twice on weekends to fill the family’s water tank. Their situation has felt even more tenuous lately, as her neighbor’s property was listed for sale, prompting worries about whether they’ll continue to have access to his well.</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p>“I have no idea where we would go here if that well wasn’t there,” Flores said. “It’s frustrating that we don’t have basic resources, especially in a place where they know when the summer comes it doesn’t rain. It doesn’t rain, we don’t have water.”</p>

<p>Val Verde County, where Del Rio is located, is three times the size of Rhode Island and hours from a major city. About a fifth of its nearly 50,000 residents live in poverty, a rate nearly twice the national average. Some live in <a href="https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/cdbg-colonias/colonias-history/">colonias</a> — rural communities along the U.S.-Mexico border, including illegal subdivisions that lack access to water, sewers or adequate housing.</p>

<p>The county has worked for years to bring water to residents, piecing together state and federal grants. Yet <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/divisions/colonias-database">about 2,000 people</a> — more than 4% of the county’s population — still lack running water, according to a database kept by the Texas Office of the Attorney General. For those residents, it means showering at fitness centers and doing the dishes once a week with water from plastic jugs.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            Some neighborhoods along the Mexican border on the outskirts of Del Rio, such as the area where Cierra Flores and her 6-year-old daughter, Olivia, live, still lack infrastructure like paved roads and access to safe drinking water.
    
    
    
    

    

        
    
                    
<p>In the early 1990s, then-Gov. Ann Richards, a Democrat, toured some of the state’s colonias along the border to assess the living conditions. After stepping into the mud on an unpaved street, she’s said to have been so moved by the scene that she told a staffer, “Whatever they want, give it to them.”</p>

<p>Fuentes, a community organizer, likes to tell that story because it drives home how long residents have fought for water and other improvements but been stymied by state and local politics and limited funds.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be an uphill battle, but we are going to keep on battling,” she said. “What else is there to do?”</p>
        
    
                    
<p>Over the past 30 years, the state has provided more than $1 billion in grants and loans to bring drinking water and wastewater treatment to colonias and other economically distressed areas. Texas 2036, a nonpartisan public policy think tank, <a href="https://texas2036.org/posts/testimony-1b-to-water-infrastructure-fund-is-a-welcome-first-step/">estimates Texas needs nearly $154 billion</a> by 2050 to meet water demands across the state amid population growth, the ongoing drought and aging infrastructure. </p>

<p>Texas state leaders said they are committed to investing in water projects and infrastructure. Gov. Greg Abbott’s office said he is calling on the Legislature to dedicate $1 billion a year for 10 years and is looking forward to working with lawmakers “to ensure Texans have a safe, reliable water supply for the next 50 years.” </p>

<p>Kim Carmichael, a spokesperson for Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows, a Republican from Lubbock, said, “Texas is at a critical juncture with its water supply, and every lawmaker recognizes the need to act decisively and meaningfully invest to further secure our water future.” The Texas House’s base budget proposes $2.5 billion for water infrastructure.</p>

<p>One of the challenges — at the federal and state level — is that infrastructure needs often exceed available funds, said <a href="https://www.rcap.org/our-people/">Olga Morales-Pate</a>, chief executive officer of Rural Community Assistance Partnership, a national network of nonprofits that works with rural communities on access to safe drinking water and wastewater issues. “So it becomes a competitive process: Who gets there faster, who has a better application, who is shovel ready to get those funding opportunities out?” she said.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            Community organizer Karen Gonzalez is frustrated that residents of the Del Rio area still lack water access while state leaders focus on border security.
    
    
    
    

    

        
    
                    
<p>The plight of people without water often gets overlooked, said Karen Gonzalez, an organizer who used to work with Fuentes. Even though she grew up in Del Rio, it wasn’t until she started to work with the community that she learned some county residents didn’t have water.</p>

<p>“Every person that I come across that I tell that we’re working this issue is like, ‘There’s people that don’t have water?’” she said. “It’s not something that is known.” </p>

<p>Unlike border security, which is constantly in the spotlight.</p>

<p>During his inauguration, Trump praised Abbott as a “leader of the pack” on border security. In 2021, Abbott launched Operation Lone Star, a multibillion-dollar effort aimed at curbing illegal immigration and drug trafficking. As part of the operation, the state has awarded Val Verde County and the city of Del Rio more than $10 million in grants, state data obtained by The Texas Tribune shows.</p>

<p>A state-funded border wall that has gone up in the county a short distance from the Rio Grande stretches in fits and starts, including next to a neighborhood without running water. As of November, <a href="https://apps.texastribune.org/features/2024/texas-border-wall-greg-abbott-landowners/">about 5 miles</a> of it had cost at least $162 million, according to the Tribune. The state Legislature’s proposed budget <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/25/texas-senate-budget-approval/">includes $6.5 billion</a> to maintain “current border security operations.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, organizers, elected officials and residents say state and federal programs to fund water infrastructure will continue to fall short of the need. Last year, the state fund created by lawmakers in 1989 to help underserved areas access drinking water had $200 million in applications for assistance and only $100 million in available funding.</p>

<p>When grants are awarded, water projects can take years to complete because of increasing costs and unforeseen construction difficulties — like hitting unexpected bedrock while laying pipe, said Val Verde County Judge Lewis Owens. Project delays — some of them, Owens acknowledged, the county’s fault — impede the ability to get future grants.</p>

<p>Organizers like Fuentes and Karen Gonzalez said their frustration with the slow progress on water has grown as they’ve watched the border wall go up and billions more dollars spent to deploy state troopers and the National Guard to aid federal border security officers.</p>

<p>“It’s just infuriating,” Karen Gonzalez said. She said she hopes elected officials “focus on what our actual border community needs are. And for us, I feel like it’s not border security.”</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

    
        
            
            
            

            Sections of the border wall are being built as part of Gov. Greg Abbott’s Operation Lone Star on the outskirts of Del Rio, near neighborhoods without access to safe drinking water.

<p>As paramedics loaded her 8-year-old son into a helicopter in the Arizona border town of Douglas, Nina Nelson did her best to reassure him. Days earlier, Jacob and his father had been riding ATVs on their ranch in far southeastern Arizona, along the U.S.-Mexico border. Dust irritated Jacob’s lungs, and over the next few days his breathing deteriorated until Nelson could see him fight for every breath.</p>

<p>He needed care that isn’t available in Douglas, a town of about 15,000. And he would have to make the trip without her.</p>

<p>“Buddy, you’re gonna be OK,” she recalled telling him. She knew it would take more than twice as long to drive the 120 miles to Tucson and the nearest hospital that could provide the care he needed. “I’m gonna be racing up there. I’ll be there. I’m gonna find you,” she said.</p>

<p>Douglas lost its hospital nearly a decade ago. Southeast Arizona Medical Center had struggled financially for years and by 2015 was staffed by out-of-state doctors. When it ran afoul of federal rules too many times, <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2015/07/31/douglas-community-hospital-closure/30976683/">jeopardizing patient safety</a>, the government pulled its ability to bill Medicare and Medicaid and it closed within a week.</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p>As her son’s breathing took a turn for the worse, Nelson considered the variables everyone in Douglas confronts in a medical emergency. Should she go to the town’s stand-alone emergency room, which treats only the most basic maladies? Drive the half hour to Bisbee or an hour to Sierra Vista for slightly higher levels of care? Or could Jacob endure the two hours it takes to drive to Tucson?</p>

<p>“That is the kind of game you play: ‘How much time do I think I have?’” Nelson said.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            Nina Nelson’s son Jacob has been transported twice by helicopter to get medical care because Douglas lacks a full-service hospital.
    
    
    
    

    

        
    
                    
<p>Arizona hasn’t been as aggressive as Texas in funding border security. But when concerns about the border surge, money often follows.</p>

<p>In 2021, the state created the Border Security Fund and allocated $55 million to it. A year later, then-Gov. Doug Ducey asked state lawmakers for $50 million for border security. They gave him more than 10 times that amount, including $335 million for a border wall. The measure was proposed by Sen. David Gowan, a Republican who represents Douglas. In October 2022, crews began stacking shipping containers along the border in Cochise County, where Douglas is located. Gowan’s spokesperson said he wasn’t available for comment.</p>

<p>The container wall wasn’t effective. <a href="https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/migrants-at-arizona-border-unhindered-by-shipping-container-wall">Migrants slipped through</a> gaps between containers, and a section toppled over. When the federal government sued, claiming the construction was trespassing on federal land, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/arizona-mexico-border-shipping-containers-9c39f308e027ac1951c1eaa7cc052142">Ducey had the container wall removed</a>.</p>

<p>The cost of erecting, then disassembling the wall: $197 million. (The state recouped about $1.4 million by selling the containers.)</p>

<p>Daniel Scarpinato, Ducey’s former chief of staff, said border security is a significant issue for nearby communities and requires resources, “especially given the failures of the federal government.” He noted that the Ducey administration didn’t ignore other needs in the area, including spending to attract doctors to rural Arizona. “But we will make no apologies for prioritizing public safety and security at our border,” he said.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            Southeast Arizona Medical Center closed in 2015, leaving the Douglas area without a full-service hospital.
    
    
    
    

    

        
    
                    
<p>Grijalva, a Douglas native, was sworn in as mayor in December with a list of needs he is determined to make progress on: a community center, more food assistance for the growing number of hungry residents and a hospital. Money the state spent on the container wall would’ve been better used on those projects, he said. “I appreciate Doug Ducey trying that, but those resources could have gone into the community,” he said.</p>

<p>The median income in Douglas is $39,000, about half the state’s median income, and almost a third of the town’s residents live in poverty. A shrinking tax base makes it difficult for Douglas to provide basic services. The town doesn’t have enough money for street repairs, let alone to reopen a hospital. The backlog of repaving projects has climbed to $67 million, while Douglas nets only $400,000 a year for street improvements.</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p>Money for wall construction or National Guard units gives a short-term boost to the economy, but those efforts can also interfere with the economic lifeblood of towns like Douglas: cross-border traffic.</p>

<p>Both Trump and Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, have deployed hundreds of guard members and active military personnel to the border. None have shown up in Douglas yet, Grijalva said. When they do, they’ll spend money. But a couple dozen troops don’t compare to the 3.6 million people who cross the border each year. The Walmart in Douglas, a stone’s throw from the port of entry, is packed daily with shoppers from Agua Prieta, Sonora, Grijalva said. More troops on both sides of the port bottleneck traffic and raise people’s fears of being detained, which may discourage them from crossing, even when they are doing so legally, he said.</p>

<p>Shortly after Trump’s inauguration, Grijalva declared a state of emergency, which could make the city eligible for federal aid if its economy takes a hit. “I know the executive orders didn’t do anything to stop the legal immigration, but it’s the perception,” Grijalva said. “If our economy dips in any way, they could give us some funding.”</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            Douglas’ new mayor, Jose Grijalva, declared a state of emergency in January over concerns that Trump’s executive orders on border security and immigration will harm the border town’s fragile economy.
    
    
    
    

    

        
    
                    
<p>Attracting a new hospital is a longer-term effort. Construction alone could cost upwards of $75 million. But then it would have to be staffed. In its final years, the hospital in Douglas suffered from the shortage of health care professionals plaguing much of rural America. The year it closed, it had no onsite physicians, said Dr. Dan Derksen, director of the Arizona Center for Rural Health. The state has programs to address that problem, including helping doctors in rural areas repay school loans. But the shortage has persisted. If a hospital were to open again in Douglas, it could cost as much as $775,000 to launch a residency program there, according to Derksen and Dr. Conrad Clemens, who heads graduate medical education for the University of Arizona.</p>

<p>“There’s policy strategies that you can do at the state level that help, but there’s no single strategy that is a cure-all,” Derksen said. “You have to do a variety of strategies.”</p>

<p>Border security funding, on the other hand, is easier to get.</p>

<p>Cochise County Sheriff Mark Dannels is known for his aggressive border enforcement activities. His office soaks up state and federal grants to help with drug interdiction, human trafficking and surveillance equipment on the border. The state also awarded him $20 million for a new jail and $5 million to open a border security operations center, a base for various agencies enforcing the border, in Sierra Vista, about an hour from Douglas.</p>

<p>At its grand opening in November, Dannels said all he had to do was ask for the money.</p>

<p>“I was speaking with Gov. Ducey and the governor asked me, ‘What do you guys need?’” Dannels said. “I said, ‘We need a collective center that drives actions.’” Shortly after, the plan came together, he said.</p>

<p>However, if Cochise Regional Hospital were still open, Dannels’ office would have one less security concern. The abandoned building, which is deteriorating in an isolated pocket of desert on the outskirts of Douglas, is a common waypoint for smugglers.</p>

<p>In February, the FDA found problems with cleaning and testing at the plant in Madhya Pradesh, India, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/glenmark-pharmaceuticals-recalls-fda-oversight">which was the subject of a ProPublica investigation last year</a>. The current recalls, listed in an FDA enforcement report last week, cover a wide range of commonly prescribed medicines, including ones that treat epilepsy, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, heart disease and high blood pressure, among other ailments. ​​A full list of the <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/ires/index.cfm?Event=96474">recalled medications is available here</a>.  </p>

<p>The agency determined that the drugs could cause temporary or reversible harm and that the chance of more serious problems was remote. However, the FDA didn’t say what symptoms the flawed drugs could cause. ProPublica asked the FDA and Glenmark for more specifics, but neither responded.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>Records show that Glenmark <a href="https://www.ipdpharma.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Glenmark-Recall-3.18.2025.pdf">first alerted wholesalers about the recalls</a> in a March 13 letter. That letter suggests that Glenmark pulled the drugs because of potential cross-contamination. Thomas Callaghan, Glenmark’s executive director of regulatory affairs for North America, wrote that 148 batches of the recalled medicines were made “in a shared facility” with two cholesterol-lowering drugs, ezetimibe and a combination of that drug and simvastatin. </p>

<p>That’s a concern because the chemical structure of ezetimibe contains what’s known as a beta-lactam ring. FDA safety experts pay attention to this because many beta-lactam drugs, particularly penicillin, can cause life-threatening allergies and hypersensitivity reactions. It’s the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2818947">most commonly reported drug allergy</a> in the U.S. Because of that danger, the FDA requires manufacturers to follow <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/159358/download">special precautions to prevent cross-contamination</a> with drugs that contain a beta-lactam ring, even if they aren’t antibiotics. </p>

<p>The chemical structure of ezetimibe, Callaghan wrote to Glenmark’s wholesalers, shows it is unlikely to cause such hypersensitivity reactions. Nevertheless, Glenmark was recalling the drugs “based on risk assessment and out of an abundance of caution,” Callaghan wrote. He added, “This recall is being made with knowledge of the Food and Drug Administration.”</p>

<p>According to Callaghan’s letter, the potential problem dates back years. The executive wrote that Glenmark began shipping the drugs on Oct. 4, 2022.</p>

<p>In December, ProPublica revealed that the Glenmark factory was responsible for an outsized share of U.S. recalls for pills that didn’t dissolve properly and could harm people. At the time, the FDA hadn’t inspected the plant since before the COVID-19 pandemic, even though one of those recalls had been linked to deaths of American patients. </p>

<p>About two months after that investigation was published, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/glenmark-pharmaceuticals-recalls-fda-inspection">FDA officials returned to the factory</a> — the agency’s first inspection in five years. Inspectors discovered that Glenmark hadn’t properly cleaned equipment to prevent contamination of medicines with residues from other drugs. The federal investigators also noted that Glenmark routinely released some drugs to the U.S. market using test methods that hadn’t been adequately validated, according to the inspection report. </p>

<p>What’s more, when some Glenmark tests found problems with a drug, the company at times declared those results invalid and “retested with new samples to obtain passing results,” the inspection report said. “The batches were ultimately released to the US market.”</p>

<p>In <a href="https://legacy.www.documentcloud.org/documents/25591264-fda-483-inspection-report-of-glenmarks-madhya-pradesh-factory/">their detailed report</a>, the inspectors listed drugs shipped to U.S. customers who had been affected by the potential contamination and testing problems, but FDA censors redacted page after page, making it impossible to know which medicines may not be safe. An FDA attorney said the information was being withheld because it contained trade secrets or commercial information that was considered privileged or confidential.</p>

<p>ProPublica first asked Glenmark about that inspection on March 7 after obtaining the FDA report through the Freedom of Information Act. Glenmark alerted wholesalers about the recalls less than a week later, but the company and the FDA didn’t tell ProPublica. </p>

<p>Instead, a Glenmark spokesperson sent a statement saying the company was “committed to working diligently with the FDA to ensure compliance with manufacturing operations and quality systems.” And the FDA said it could discuss potential compliance matters only with the company involved. </p>

<p>The FDA first mentioned the recalls publicly in its April 8 <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/ires/index.cfm?Event=96474">enforcement report</a>, which is like an electronic filing cabinet for recalls. The recalls do not appear on the FDA’s <a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts">recalls website</a>, which compiles press releases written by pharmaceutical companies. </p>

<p>ProPublica asked the FDA and Glenmark why they didn’t alert the public last month that these medicines had been recalled, but neither responded. </p>

<p>Glenmark is embroiled in a federal lawsuit that alleges recalled potassium chloride capsules made at its Madhya Pradesh factory caused the death of a 91-year-old Maine woman in June. The FDA had determined last year that more than 50 million of those recalled Glenmark extended-release capsules <a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/glenmark-pharmaceuticals-inc-usa-issues-voluntary-nationwide-recall-potassium-chloride-extended">had the potential to kill</a> U.S. patients because they didn’t dissolve correctly and could lead to a perilous spike in potassium. In court filings, Glenmark has denied responsibility for the woman’s death.</p>

<p>Since that potassium chloride recall, Glenmark has told federal regulators it has received reports of eight deaths in the U.S. of people who took the recalled capsules, FDA records show. Companies are required to file such reports so the agency can monitor drug safety. The FDA shares few details, though, so ProPublica was unable to independently verify what happened in each case. In general, the FDA says these adverse event reports reflect the opinions of the people who reported the harm and don’t prove that the drug caused it.</p>

Title    : Two Months After Trump’s Funding Cuts, a Nonprofit Struggles to Support Refugees and Itself

                <p>ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. <a href="https://www.propublica.org/newsletters/dispatches?source=54G&amp;placement=top-note&amp;region=local">Sign up for Dispatches</a>, a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.</p>

            

                

      
  



                    
<p>When Max Rykov started reading a Jan. 24 letter sent to the leaders of the country’s 10 refugee resettlement agencies, he found the wording vague but ominous. The <a href="https://legacy.www.documentcloud.org/documents/25893969-suspension-letter-for-foreign-assistance-gr/">agencies were ordered</a> to “stop all work” funded by the Department of State and “not incur any new costs.”</p>

<p>At first, he wondered if the order from the Trump administration was only targeting refugee work in other countries. Rykov, then the director of development and communications at a refugee resettlement partner in Nashville, began texting colleagues at other agencies. “What does it mean?” he asked. </p>

<p>By Monday, three days after the memo, it became clear. The Nashville International Center for Empowerment, along with similar nonprofits across the country, would not have access to the money the government had promised to refugees for their first three months in the United States. That day, NICE laid off 12 of its 56 resettlement staff members and scrambled to free up funds to pay for the basic needs of nearly 170 people dependent on the frozen grants.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            Max Rykov arrived in the U.S. as a child and went on to become the director of development and communications at the Nashville International Center for Empowerment, which helps refugees resettle.
    
            (Arielle Weenonia Gray for ProPublica)
    
    
    

    

        
    
                    
<p>Rykov knew exactly what was at stake, and that delivered an additional dose of dread. Born in the former USSR, he and his family arrived in the U.S. as refugees in 1993, fleeing the collapse of the Soviet Union, the economic devastation and discrimination against Soviet Jews. He was 4 years old, and it was bewildering. Though his family was part of one of the largest waves of refugee resettlement in U.S. history, they ended up in a place with few Russian immigrants.</p>

<p>Life in Birmingham, Alabama, a post-industrial city shaped by the Civil Rights movement and white flight, revolved around Saturday college football games and Sunday church. Rykov said his family felt “barren” in the U.S. away from their culture. Birmingham’s Jewish community was small and the Russian population tiny.</p>

<p>But a local Jewish organization sponsored the Rykovs and paired them with a “friendship family.” The group rented them an apartment and furnished it. Then the organization helped Rykov’s parents find work. And Birmingham’s Jewish community banded together to fund scholarships for Rykov and other Soviet refugee children to attend a private Jewish school, where Rykov felt less isolated.</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p>He went on to attend the University of Alabama and overcame his feeling of otherness. After graduation, he found purpose in bringing people together through his work organizing cultural events, including arts festivals and an adult spelling bee, doing social media outreach for the Birmingham mayor and, in 2021, finding a dream job at a Nashville nonprofit devoted to the very efforts that he believes helped define him. </p>

<p>When Rykov heard that President Donald Trump’s second administration had ordered cuts to the refugee program, his thoughts raced to the Venezuelan refugee family his organization was assisting, an older woman in poor health, her daughter who cared for her and the daughter’s two children, one not yet kindergarten age. None of them spoke English, and there was no plan for how they would cover the rent, which was due in four days. </p>

<p>“This is a promise that we made to these people that we have reneged on,” he said. “Is that really what’s happening? Yeah, that’s exactly what’s happening.”</p>

<p>As the realization of what lay ahead set in, Rykov started to cry.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>Over the next two months, the Trump administration <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344495/gov.uscourts.wawd.344495.31.0.pdf">carried out and defended</a> its destabilizing cuts to the refugee program. The moves brought wave after wave of uncertainty and chaos to the lives of refugees and those who work to help resettle them. </p>

<p>One of the largest nonprofit agencies that carry out this work, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, laid off a third of its staff in February and said Monday that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/catholic-bishops-refugee-resettlement-trump-administration-362231100b8e4650c00d22a75b5c6ab8">it would end all of its refugee efforts</a> with the federal government. A Jewish resettlement organization, <a href="https://www.jns.org/hias-fires-furloughs-40-of-staff-due-to-trump-cuts-to-refugee-work/">HIAS, cut 40% of its staf</a>f. As the groups fight legal battles to recoup the millions of dollars the government owes them, some have been forced to close resettlement offices entirely.</p>

<p>The Nashville International Center for Empowerment is still struggling to keep its own afloat. Although NICE staff members had anticipated some cuts to refugee programs under Trump, they said they were caught off guard when reimbursements for money already spent failed to appear and by the dwindling opportunities to seek recourse.</p>

<p>After a judge ordered the Trump administration to restart refugee admissions, the administration responded by canceling contracts with existing resettlement agencies and announcing plans to find new partners. And the administration has indicated it will remain resistant, refusing to spend millions appropriated by Congress for refugees.</p>

<p>“Many have lost faith and trust in the American system because of this,” said Wooksoo Kim, director of the Immigrant and Refugee Research Institute at the University of Buffalo. “For many refugees, it may start to feel like it’s no different from where they came from.” </p>

<p>In court documents, lawyers for the Department of Justice argued the U.S. does not have the capacity to support large numbers of refugees.</p>

<p>“The President lawfully exercised his authority to suspend the admission of refugees pending a determination that ‘further entry into the United States of refugees aligns with the interests of the United States,’” the motion said. </p>

<p>In Nashville, that anxiety has been playing out week after week in tear-filled offices and in apartment complexes teeming with families who fled war and oppression.</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p>Rykov couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed by the extreme shift in attitudes about immigrants in just a few years. In 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine, his family’s dormant fears about Russia were reawakened — but they felt a surge of pride for the U.S. when it stepped up to help Ukraine and welcome its refugees. </p>

<p>Months after the invasion, Ukrainian athletes came to Birmingham for the World Games, which is similar to the Olympics. When they entered the stadium waving the Ukrainian flag, the crowd gave them a <a href="https://www.cbs42.com/news/ukrainian-athlete-reacts-to-the-world-games-opening-ceremony/">standing ovation</a>. His parents, who’d never felt quite at home in the U.S., loudly joined in the “U-S-A” chant that followed.</p>

<p>But now, three years later, was all of America now ready to abandon refugees? Rykov was starting to see the signs, but he refused to believe it and instead recommitted himself to the work.</p>

<p>He and his colleagues reached out to every donor in their network and called an online meeting with local churches who might be able to help with rent payments, food, job searches and transportation. </p>

<p>Agencies would struggle without the help of the churches. And churches don’t have the resources, training or bandwidth to carry out the work of the agencies. </p>

<p>But Rykov knew that for the time being, he’d need more help than ever from church volunteers.</p>

<p>“Without your intervention here, this is gonna be a humanitarian disaster in Nashville,” he told them in the online meeting held about a week after the cuts. “And in every community, obviously, but we were focusing on ours. We’re not gonna be in a position to help in the same way much longer, and this is a stark reality that we’re facing.”</p>

<p>Then he went <a href="https://www.newschannel5.com/news/we-cant-let-them-down-federal-funding-freeze-puts-refugees-at-risk-in-nashville?fbclid=IwY2xjawJhGEhleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHmKOpjhdkkHqFPkvTvgd5MUpY1YPWxPWWNaThe6Sa_ECdJz7HrwVIYKQ9Guc_aem_WssM1rMgk-3IAIXrFi6xsg">on the local news</a>, warning that “this immediate funding freeze puts those recently arrived refugees really at risk of homelessness.” The responses on social media reflected the hate and intolerance that had polluted the national conversation about immigration.</p>

<p>“The common theme was, ‘Refugees? Do you mean “illegal invaders”?’” Rykov recalled. “People are so completely misinformed, clearly not reading the article or watching the story, and it’s very disappointing to see that. And I guess it’s sad too that I expect it.”</p>
        
    
                            
    
                                One Month After the Cuts
    
    
        “No Time to Screw Around”
    
        
    
                    
<p>In late February, church volunteer Abdul Makembe and a program manager from NICE squeezed into the cramped apartment of a family of five from the Democratic Republic of Congo. </p>

<p>Both Makembe and NICE had been working with the family for months, but with the loss of funding, NICE could no longer offer support and had asked Makembe to be more involved.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            Abdul Makembe, who immigrated from Tanzania, volunteers to help African families settle in the U.S.
    
            (Arielle Weenonia Gray for ProPublica)
    
    
    

    

        
    
                    
<p>A native of Tanzania, Makembe moved to Tennessee in the late 1970s. After working in infectious disease research and nonprofit management, which involved several trips to Africa, he retired in 2015 and began volunteering to help newly arrived African families. Rykov came to know him as a fixture of the refugee community, always eager to help.</p>

<p>In the apartment, Makembe perched on the edge of a couch and Mungaga Akilimali sat across from him on the floor. </p>

<p>“So, the situation has improved a little bit?” Makembe asked.</p>

<p>The Congolese man ran his hands over his head.</p>

<p>“The situation, so far, not yet,” Akilimali said. “I’m just trying to apply and reapply and reapply, but so far nothing.”</p>

<p>Akilimali and his family fled the Democratic Republic of Congo more than 10 years ago. Since 1996, soldiers and militias have killed 6 million people there and committed atrocities against countless civilians. War, political instability and widespread poverty have displaced millions of others. </p>

<p>Akilimali and his wife settled for a time in South Africa, where they encountered xenophobia and anti-immigrant violence. Immigrants and refugees have become political scapegoats there, spawning a rash of attacks and even murders. His wife, Bulonza Chishamara, nearly died there in 2018 after an ambush by an anti-immigrant mob.</p>

<p>Doctors gave her eight units of blood and Chishamara spent days paralyzed in a hospital bed, Akilimali said. She still walks with a limp.</p>

<p>The family had rejoiced when they got approved for refugee resettlement in 2024 in Tennessee. Their new life in Nashville began with promise. Akilimali, who speaks fluent English and trained as a mechanic, got a driver’s license and a job at Nissan.</p>

<p>However, he lost the job before his probationary period ended due to layoffs, and he hasn’t been able to find another one. NICE used to have a robust staff of employment specialists. But the cuts forced the organization to reassign them.</p>

<p>That left fewer resources for people like Akilimali, who had been in the U.S. longer than the three months during which new refugees were eligible for state department aid but who still needed help finding work.</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p>For Rykov, the work of spreading awareness about the cuts and raising funds to offset them intensified throughout February. He and others working with refugees across the country were hoping that the courts might force the administration to release the federal money — that if they could keep things afloat in the short term, relief would come. </p>

<p>Then, on Feb. 25, a federal judge in Washington ruled in favor of the agencies. He ordered the administration to restore payments and restart refugee admissions.</p>

<p>The relief was short-lived. A day later, the administration canceled contracts with resettlement agencies, and lawyers for the administration have appealed the order. Their argument: The gutted refugee agencies no longer have capacity to restart resettlement, making it impossible to comply with court orders. </p>

<p>Rykov said some of the diminished number of remaining staff members began to look for new jobs.</p>

<p>After that, Rykov and his team kicked into emergency mode. They worked long hours making phone calls and arranging meetings with potential volunteers and donors.</p>

<p>“It was a cocktail of emotions,” he said. The generosity of donors and volunteers filled him with gratitude. But he couldn’t escape the sense of foreboding that consumed the office, where many desks sat empty and remaining employees voiced deepening concerns about the fates of their clients.</p>

<p>Rykov likened the urgent energy at NICE to the aftermath of a natural disaster. “There’s no time to screw around.”</p>

<p>At the same time, staffers worried about the cratering budget and the future of the organization. And it was hard not to notice how much the mood in Tennessee and around the country was shifting. In an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/realigning-the-united-states-refugee-admissions-program/">order suspending refugee admissions</a>, Trump described immigrants as a “burden” who have “inundated” American towns and cities.NICE had always felt protected, powered by an idealistic and diverse staff who chose to work in refugee resettlement despite the long hours and low pay. The cuts and the discourse eroded that sense of safety, Rykov said.</p>

<p>In February, a tech company offered him a job in Birmingham. It was a chance to be closer to his parents and back in the city where he’d come of age — a reminder of an era that felt kinder than the current one. He took the job.</p>

<p>“Working at NICE, it’s the best job I ever had and the most meaningful job I ever had,” he said.</p>

<p>Rykov packed up a few things from NICE. A Ukrainian flag lapel pin. A signed photograph of him and his coworkers. In his Birmingham apartment, he placed the picture on a bookshelf next to one of him and his parents at his high school graduation.</p>

<p>By the time he left, NICE’s refugee resettlement team was down to 30 employees; it had been 56 before the cuts. For its part, NICE has vowed to carry on. The organization has paired 24 families with volunteer mentors since the funding cuts.</p>

<p>Church volunteers, who were accustomed to helping furnish and decorate apartments for new arrivals, now had to help prevent evictions. They had to track down documents and help complete paperwork lost in the confusion of the nonprofit’s layoffs. And the group of mostly retired professionals now had to assist with the daunting task of finding unskilled jobs for refugees who didn’t speak much English.</p>
        
    
                            
    
                                Two Months After the Cuts
    
    
        One Volunteer, Many People in Need
    
        
    
                    
<p>On a mid-March morning, Makembe woke at 6 a.m. to begin tackling his volunteer work for NICE. Despite the long hours he clocks volunteering, the 74-year-old has kept his energy level and his spirits up. As he left the garage apartment he shares with his wife in a rough north Nashville neighborhood, he made sure to double-check the locks. </p>

<p>On this day, he was working not with the Akilimali family but with a family of four who recently arrived from Africa. The child needs to see a specialist at the Children’s Hospital at Vanderbilt.</p>

<p>It was Vanderbilt that brought Makembe to Nashville decades ago, for his master’s degree in economic planning. He followed that with a doctorate in health policy and research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Over the years that followed, he made repeated trips back to Tanzania to do research on malaria and parasitic infections.</p>

<p>All that took a toll on Makembe’s marriage, and he and his first wife divorced when his two children were very young. They are now grown and successful. His son is an accountant and his daughter recently finished law school and works at a firm in New York. That leaves him more time to spend with refugees.</p>

<p>But the volunteer work does bring some financial stress. He is trying to save $5,000 to apply for a green card for his wife, which is tough. Because he spent much of his career working outside the U.S., Makembe receives less than $1,000 a month from Social Security. He drives a 2004 Toyota that was donated to his church to aid the congregation’s work with refugees, but he pays out of pocket for gas and car insurance. The costs can add up. It’s not uncommon for him to burn a quarter tank of gas a day when he is volunteering.</p>

<p>Makembe’s church, Woodmont Hills Church, is a significant contributor to the city’s refugee resettlement work — an ethos shared by its current congregants but that has led to the loss of members over the years. Though it had a congregation nearing 3,000 members in the late ’90s, attendance shrank as the church’s ideology grew more progressive and Tennessee’s grew more conservative. It’s now down to 800 members. </p>

<p>Yet the church remained steadfast in its commitment to helping refugees. Its leaders invited NICE to hold classes in its empty meeting rooms and made space to house a Swahili church and a Baptist church formed by refugees from Myanmar. And when NICE lost funding, Woodmont Hills members donated their time and money.</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p>Makembe has helped dozens of refugees over the years but was particularly worried for the family he had to take to the Children’s Hospital that March morning, serving as both driver and translator. They arrived right before Trump cut off funding, and they had struggled to get medical care for their 5-year-old’s persistent seizures. A doctor at a local clinic had prescribed antiseizure medication, but it didn’t work, and the child experienced episodes where his muscles tensed and froze for minutes at a time.</p>

<p>Nashville has world-class medical facilities, but NICE no longer had staff available to help the family understand and navigate that care, leaving them frustrated. </p>

<p>It took months for the family to get in to see a specialist. During the long wait, Makembe said, the boy’s father began to lose hope. His son’s seizures had become longer and more frequent. Makembe stepped in to help them get a referral from a doctor at the local clinic.</p>

<p>The child’s father had to miss the doctor’s appointment that March morning so that he could go to an interview at a company that packages computer parts. Both he and his wife had been searching for jobs and striking out. Makembe has tried to help but has run into barriers. He does not have the same connections with labor agencies that NICE staffers did. </p>

<p>Makembe said he wants to get the child enrolled in a special school for the fall and find a wheelchair so his mom won’t have to carry him.</p>

<p>And that’s just this family. Makembe said new refugees have been waiting for months to get job interviews. When he visits the five families he mentors, their neighbors approach him asking for help. Many of their requests are for the assistance NICE and other refugee agencies once offered.</p>

<p>“I’m very much worried,” he said. “I mean, they have no idea of what to do.”</p>

<p>Just a week into President Donald Trump’s second term, Rep. Adriano Espaillat began to see reports of Puerto Ricans and others being questioned and arrested by immigration agents.  </p>

<p>So Espaillat, a New York Democrat, did what members of Congress often do: He <a href="https://espaillat.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/espaillat.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/01.27.25-letter-ice-raids-in-pr-nj.pdf">wrote</a> to the administration and demanded answers. That was more than 10 weeks ago. Espaillat has not received a response. </p>

<p>His experience appears to be common. </p>

<p>At least a dozen members of Congress, all Democrats, have written to the Trump administration with pointed questions about constituents and other citizens whom immigration agents have questioned, detained and even <a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2025/3/warner-pushes-trump-administration-on-alarming-immigration-arrest-of-u-s-citizen-and-virginia-resident">held at gunpoint</a>. In one letter, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee <a href="https://democrats-judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/2025-02-04_raskin_jayapal_to_noem_dhs_vitello_ice.pdf">demanded a list</a> of every citizen detained during the new administration.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>None has received an answer.</p>

<p>“What we are clearly seeing is that with this administration, they are not responding to congressional inquiries,” said Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, a New Mexico Democrat. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_demanding_a_stop_to_unconscionable_ice_harassment_of_native_american_citizens.pdf">Leger Fernández and others wrote</a> to Trump and the Department of Homeland Security on Jan. 28 after receiving complaints from constituents and tribal nations that federal agents were pressing tribal citizens in New Mexico for their immigration status, raising concerns about racial profiling.</p>

<p>The congresswoman and others say the lack of response is part of a broader pattern in which the administration has been moving to sideline Congress and its constitutional power to <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S8-C18-7-1/ALDE_00013657/">investigate the executive branch</a>.</p>

<p>“That is a big concern on a level beyond what ICE is doing,” Leger Fernández said, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a branch of DHS. “This administration does not seem to recognize the power and authority and responsibility” of Congress.</p>

<p>Norman Ornstein, a longtime congressional observer at the American Enterprise Institute, said prior administrations’ lack of responsiveness has frustrated lawmakers too. But he’s never seen one so thoroughly brush off Congress.  </p>

<p>“What’s clear now is that the message from Donald Trump and his minions is: ‘You don’t have to respond to these people, whether they are ours or not,’” Ornstein said, referring to Republicans and Democrats. “That’s not usual. Nothing about this is usual.”</p>

<p>A White House spokesperson denied that the administration has been circumventing Congress or its oversight. “Passage of the continuing resolution that kept our government open and commonsense legislation like the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/laken-riley-act-explained.html">Laken Riley Act</a> are indicative of how closely the Trump administration is working with Congress,” said Kush Desai in a statement. </p>

<p>The White House did not answer questions about the letters. DHS also did not respond to ProPublica’s questions.</p>

<p>Last month, ProPublica detailed how <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/more-americans-will-be-caught-up-trump-immigration-raids">Americans have been caught</a> in the administration’s dragnet. Such mistakes have been made by many administrations over decades. The government often has not taken steps to reduce errors, such as updating its files when agents confirm somebody’s citizenship. But experts and advocates have warned that Trump’s aggressive immigration goals — including <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/01/26/ice-arrests-raids-trump-quota/">arrest quotas</a> for enforcement agents — make it more likely that citizens will get caught up.</p>

<p>ICE and its sister agency, Customs and Border Protection, said in earlier statements to ProPublica that agents are allowed to ask for citizens’ identification. The agencies did not provide explanations for their actions in most of the cases ProPublica asked about. </p>

<p>Answers were also hard to come by during Trump’s first term, even when Democrats controlled the House and had more power over hearings. </p>

<p>At a House hearing in 2019 about <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/children-separated-from-parents-border-patrol-cbp-trump-immigration-policy">family separation</a>, lawmakers pressed then-Border Patrol Chief Brian Hastings about another issue: the three-week detention of a Dallas-born high school student and citizen, who was only released after The Dallas Morning News <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/immigration/2019/07/26/a-dallas-born-citizen-picked-up-by-the-border-patrol-has-been-detained-for-three-weeks-his-lawyer-says/">reported what happened</a>. </p>

<p>Hastings said the student never claimed to be a citizen during his detention — though <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/immigration/2019/07/25/a-border-patrol-chief-testifies-that-francisco-galicia-never-claimed-u-s-citizenship-but-document-says-otherwise/">the newspaper reported</a> that the agency’s own paperwork noted the opposite. Hastings also declined to give any broader accounting of how often the agency had held Americans. “I don’t have information about specific cases,” he said. (Hastings did not respond to requests for comment.)</p>

<p>Espaillat, the New York representative, has been in office for eight years. He said he frequently raised immigration questions and concerns during the Biden administration too, and got responses.</p>

<p>Republicans complained about the opposite experience during the Biden administration. <a href="https://homeland.house.gov/2024/11/01/chairman-green-subpoenas-dhs-secretary-mayorkas-over-failure-to-produce-documents-on-inoperable-surveillance-cameras-along-the-southwest-border/#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2C%20D.C.%20%E2%80%94%20Yesterday%2C%20House,deployed%20along%20the%20Southwest%20border">They said</a> the administration was unresponsive to Congress’ questions on immigration, forcing lawmakers to <a href="https://homeland.house.gov/2024/04/30/new-documents-reveal-airports-used-by-secretary-mayorkas-to-fly-hundreds-of-thousands-of-inadmissible-aliens-into-u-s-via-chnv-mass-parole-scheme/">subpoena officials</a> for answers. (The administration <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4601171-house-republicans-subpoena-mayorkas-over-migrant-numbers/">dismissed</a> the moves as “political posturing.”) </p>

<p>Espaillat said he’s not surprised the Trump administration has been silent. “They probably don’t have a good answer.”</p>

Title    : Trump’s DOJ Has Frozen Police Reform Work. Advocates Fear More Abuse in Departments Across the Country.

<p>When news broke in January that the Trump Justice Department was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/civil-rights-division-justice-department-trump-2dcb45cca7c9c9cdaea78282d4279c35">freezing significant work on civil rights litigation, including police reform cases</a>, attention immediately focused on two cities: Minneapolis and Louisville, Kentucky.</p>

<p>Both places were on the cusp of entering court-enforced agreements to overhaul their police forces after high-profile police killings there sparked a nationwide reckoning over race and policing.</p>

<p>But it’s now clear that the administration’s move will be felt well beyond those two cities. In fact, it throws into question police reform efforts in at least eight other communities across the country, according to a ProPublica review. The need for change in these places was documented in a flurry of investigations published by the Justice Department in the final year of Joe Biden’s presidency. All of the probes found a “pattern or practice” of unlawful behavior that was routine enough that the federal government recommended reforms.</p>

<p>From Phoenix to Trenton, New Jersey, federal officials investigating the eight agencies found unjustified killings, excessive force, debtors’ prisons, retaliation against police critics, racial discrimination, unlawful strip searches and officers having sexual contact with sex workers during undercover operations.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>Such findings are typically the first step toward a department agreeing to federal oversight and court-ordered reform. Over the years, the DOJ has credited such agreements, known as consent decrees, for having helped departments reduce unnecessary use of force, cut crime rates and improve responses to people with behavioral health needs. President Donald Trump’s Justice Department, however, has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/22/politics/justice-department-trump-police-reform-agreements/index.html">ordered its civil rights attorneys</a> to pause such work until further notice, effectively reinstating the limited approach it took during the president’s first term. Department officials did not respond to questions about the pause or how long it would remain in effect.</p>

<p>For now, that means any reform efforts will be up to local leadership — a dynamic that experts say could bode poorly for communities with long histories of police abuse.</p>

<p>Cliff Johnson, an attorney and director of the Mississippi office of the MacArthur Justice Center, a nonprofit legal organization, was not optimistic.</p>

<p>“While those DOJ reports sometimes can lead municipalities, police departments and other offenders to come to Jesus,” Johnson said, “what we’ve been seeing, from our perspective, is folks saying, ‘I don’t need Jesus. I got Trump.’”</p>

<p>Louisiana leaders, for example, have slammed the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25599567-findings-report-louisiana-state-police/">Justice Department’s report</a>, which found a pattern of problems in the way the state police used force against civilians. Gov. Jeff Landry said the report was an attempt by the Biden administration to “diminish the service and exceptionality” of the state police. And state Attorney General Liz Murrill said the Justice Department was being used to “advance a political agenda.”</p>

<p>The report was partly spurred by the 2019 death of Ronald Greene, who was killed while in the custody of Louisiana State Police. Officers repeatedly shocked him with a Taser, dragged him by his ankle shackles and then left him face down in the road. Some officers deactivated or muted their body cameras during the incident. Louisiana troopers had claimed Greene died when his car crashed after a high-speed chase. The department was forced to change its story when The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/police-brutality-louisiana-ronald-greene-race-civil-rights-4446d9b069803545247c610882951763">Associated Press obtained and published</a> body-camera footage of the incident.</p>

<p>Federal investigators found the episode was not an outlier. According to their report, officers in the department used Tasers without warning and against people who were restrained or who did not pose a threat, didn’t give people the chance to comply before using force, used force against people who weren’t a threat, and used excessive force against people running from officers.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the Louisiana State Police did not answer questions about the report’s findings but said the agency is working to improve its relationship with citizens and other stakeholders. Landry’s office did not respond to ProPublica’s questions about the report and the state’s response, and Murrill’s office declined to comment.</p>

<p>Across the state line in <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25599570-findings-report-lexington-police-department/">Lexington, Mississippi</a>, the Justice Department’s shift away from police accountability could also be consequential. Department officials said residents there were so afraid of local police that they were hesitant to meet with investigators in public, fearful of retaliation.</p>

<p>They had good reason to be concerned. In 2023, officers arrested an attorney who was representing citizens in police abuse cases against the department. She had been filming a traffic stop at the time.</p>

<p>The police force — made up of about 10 officers, some of whom are part time — is the smallest the Justice Department has investigated in decades. Federal investigators ultimately found that its officers use excessive force, discriminate against Black people, conduct stops and searches without probable cause, and arrest people purely for not having the money to pay fines.</p>

<p>It’s unclear what steps, if any, the Lexington Police Department is taking in response to the report. Police Chief Charles Henderson declined to comment and directed questions to the city attorney, who did not return a call.</p>

<p>Reform advocates have put their hopes in upcoming elections in Lexington that could bring in new leadership that is more interested in making changes at the police department.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25599569-findings-report-investigation-of-the-mount-vernon-police-department/">Mount Vernon, New York</a>, advocates say they’ve seen little movement since the Justice Department found police there use excessive force, conduct unlawful strip and body cavity searches of arrestees, and fail to properly train officers and supervisors. It also found police discriminated against Black people. One group is considering legal action to bring the city to the table.</p>

<p>“It seems like Mount Vernon has put lip service on addressing the findings,” said Daniel Lambright, an attorney with the New York Civil Liberties Union. “It remains unclear actually what they’re doing to address the findings.”</p>

<p>In their report, federal investigators expressed concern that the police department’s “overly aggressive tactics unnecessarily escalate encounters.” In one instance, they wrote, five Mount Vernon officers used force on a man they thought was selling drugs — without announcing their presence or attempting to arrest him peacefully. Instead, one of the officers approached the man from behind and attempted to put him in an “upper body hold,” which started an altercation, according to the report. Police then threw the man to the ground. One officer drove his Taser into the suspect five times while another repeatedly punched him in the head. The man suffered a broken nose.</p>

<p>“The reform efforts have to continue,” said the Rev. Stephen Pogue, a member of the United Black Clergy of Westchester, an organization that works on social justice matters in Mount Vernon and surrounding areas. “We’re not in one of those places where Trump is our god. In Mount Vernon, we still need Jesus.”</p>

<p>Pogue said he hopes the city will host a public meeting about the report before the summer.</p>

<p>Mayor Shawyn Patterson-Howard and a police spokesperson did not reply to interview requests. But in December, the mayor said in a statement that the city would work with the Justice Department to address its findings. “We wholeheartedly support our good officers and at the same time will not tolerate and will punish unconstitutional policing,” she said.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25599574-phoenix-findings-report-final-final-508/">Phoenix</a>, city and police officials have sent conflicting signals about the federal investigation, which found the Police Department used excessive and deadly force, violated the rights of homeless people, and discriminated against Black, Latino, Native American people, as well as those who have behavioral disabilities. “Why the hell would anybody ever accept a consent decree?” said one City Council member months before the report was released. Afterward, the head of the police union said the investigation was a “farce” and part of an “unprofessional smear campaign.”</p>

<p>But Mayor Kate Gallego has said the city is taking the report seriously. In September, the City Council passed several police reform measures, including requiring all officers who deal with the public to use body-worn cameras, even the special units that have been at the center of controversial shootings.</p>

<p>“Regardless of the new federal administration, these reforms are moving forward, and the mayor’s commitment to improving the police department is unwavering,” a mayoral spokesperson told ProPublica.</p>

<p>Some of the other cities the Justice Department had targeted are taking small steps toward fixing problems the federal investigators identified, though it’s unclear whether the efforts will result in lasting change.</p>

<p>In Oklahoma City, where <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25599575-findings-report-investigation-of-oklahoma-oklahoma-city-and-oklahoma-city-police-department/">Justice found in January</a> that police officers discriminate against people with behavioral health disabilities, the city recently began funding mobile mental health units that can respond to incidents instead of police, said Jessica Hawkins, chair of the city’s Crisis Intervention Advisory Group. She said the city is also working on a written response to the DOJ report but didn’t know when it would be completed.</p>

<p>Police Chief Ron Bacy declined ProPublica’s request for an interview and through a spokesperson said the department was “still reviewing the report.”</p>

<p>In Memphis, Tennessee, where <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25599572-findings-report-memphis-police-department-and-the-city-of-memphis-0-0/">federal investigators found</a> that police use excessive force, conduct unlawful stops and discriminate against Black people, the mayor put together a reform task force, led by a retired federal judge. “The DOJ report, in our case, kick-started a conversation that had sort of gone cold,” said Josh Spickler, executive director of Just City, an organization that works on litigation and justice matters in Memphis.</p>

<p>And in <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25599571-findings-report-investigation-of-the-city-of-trenton-and-trenton-police-department/">Trenton, New Jersey</a>, where the Justice Department found that local police have a pattern or practice of using excessive force and conducting unlawful pedestrian and vehicle stops, City Council member Jasi Edwards has been hosting community meetings to introduce the idea of a civilian complaint review board and build support for the measure. Edwards said she plans to formally put forth her proposal sometime in the fall.</p>

<p>It will likely run into resistance, though. Representatives of the Police Department and mayor told ProPublica that they didn’t believe a civilian review board was necessary because it would be costly and there are existing ways for citizens to complain about police conduct. The DOJ report, they said, highlighted some areas in need of improvement but mischaracterized a number of cases and gave an inaccurate depiction of the department’s culture.</p>

<p>In Worcester, Massachusetts, reforms are already moving forward in response to the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25599568-finding-report-worcester-pd/">Justice Department’s investigation</a>.</p>

<p>Last month, the police chief released a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25893819-worcester-police-doj-response/">15-page report</a> on proposed measures intended to remedy the problems identified by federal investigators. The changes, which are still awaiting legal review, include prohibiting police from releasing K-9 dogs into mass gatherings or riot scenes and requiring a supervisor to go to a scene if someone reports being injured by police.</p>

<p>The police chief, Paul Socier, has also proposed several changes to how officers approach prostitution. Investigators found the department engaged in “outrageous government conduct” with sex workers by having sexual contact during undercover operations.</p>

<p>“We are hopefully headed in the right direction,” said Audra Doody, co-executive director of Safe Exit Initiative, an organization in Worcester that provides services, housing and counseling to sex workers who want to leave the sex trade. “With a time of such uncertainty, I want to believe our people in the community are telling the truth and actually are going to do what they say they’re going to do, which they seem like they are, right now.”</p>

Title    : American Rendition: Rümeysa Öztürk’s Journey From Ph.D. Scholar to Trump Target Languishing in Louisiana Cell

<p>With a line of cars waiting behind them at the train station, the two women hugged tightly as they said goodbye at the end of a spring break that hadn’t turned out to be the relaxing vacation they’d imagined.</p>

<p>Their girls trip had transformed into endless conversations about security precautions as one of the friends, 30-year-old Turkish national Rümeysa Öztürk, grew increasingly worried she would become a target of the Trump administration’s deportation campaign.</p>

<p>Öztürk, a former Fulbright scholar in a doctoral program at Tufts University, was stunned to find out in early March that she had been targeted by a pro-Israel group that highlighted an op-ed she co-wrote last year criticizing the school’s response to the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Her concern deepened days later with the detention of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/nyregion/khalil-jena-deportation-ruling.html">former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil</a>, a permanent resident the government is trying to deport over his role in pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campus.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>By the time of Öztürk’s spring break trip on March 15, she was consumed with anxiety, said her friend E., an Arab American academic on the East Coast who asked to withhold her name and other identifying details for security reasons.</p>

<p>During their reunion in E.’s hometown, the first time they’d been together since the summer, the friends looked up know-your-rights tutorials and discussed whether Öztürk should cut short her doctoral program. They spent their last day together filling out intake forms for legal aid groups — just in case.</p>

<p>Right up until their last minutes together at the train station, they wrestled with how cautious Öztürk should be when she returned to Massachusetts. Öztürk wondered if she should avoid communal dinners, a feature of Muslim social life during the holy month of Ramadan.</p>

<p>“I told her to keep going out, to be with her community. I wanted her to live her life,” E. recalled, her voice breaking.</p>

<p>“And then she got abducted in broad daylight.”</p>

<p>By now, much of the country has seen the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/us/video/tufts-student-detained-rumeysa-ozturk-ice-digvid">footage of Oztürk’s capture</a>.</p>

<p>Surveillance video from March 25 shows her walking to dinner in Somerville, Massachusetts, near the Tufts campus, chatting on the phone with her mother when she is swarmed by six masked plainclothes officers. Öztürk screams.</p>

<p>Within three minutes, she’s bundled into an unmarked car and whisked away, a jarring scene that showed the nation what President Donald Trump’s deportation campaign looks like on the street level: federal agents ambushing a Muslim woman who co-wrote an op-ed in a college newspaper.</p>

<p>The footage drew worldwide outrage and turned Öztürk into a powerful symbol of the Department of Homeland Security dragnet.</p>

            (Obtained by ProPublica)
    
    
    

            <p><strong><a href="https://assets-d.propublica.org/v5/video/American-Rendition.mp4">Watch video ➜</a></strong></p>
        
    
    
        
    
                    
<p>To piece together what’s happened since then, ProPublica examined court filings and interviewed attorneys and Öztürk’s close friend, who regularly speaks to her in detention. What emerges is a more intimate picture of Öztürk and how a child development researcher charged with no crime ended up in a crowded cell in Louisiana. The interviews and court records also provide a glimpse into a sprawling, opaque apparatus designed to deport the maximum number of people with minimum accountability.</p>

<p>Her lawyers describe it as the story of a Trump-era rendition, a callback to the post-9/11 practice of federal agents grabbing Muslim suspects off the street and taking them to locations known for harsh conditions and shoddy oversight.</p>

<p>Öztürk is among nearly 1,000 students whose visas have been revoked, according to <a href="https://www.nafsa.org/ie-magazine/students-at-risk">a tally by the Association of International Educators</a>. And she is among several students and professors who have been detained.</p>

<p>Her detention was exceptional, immigration attorneys said, because it was caught on camera. What’s scariest, they say, is how fast the removals happen and how little is known about them.</p>

<p>Homeland Security spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>The video of Öztürk’s arrest surfaced because Boston-area activists had set up a hotline for locals to report interactions with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The call that came in about Öztürk reported a “kidnapping,” said Fatema Ahmad of the Muslim Justice League, part of the advocacy network that obtained the footage.</p>

<p>“What broke me was her screaming. And knowing that the same thing had just happened to almost 400 people in the Boston area the week before,” she said, referring to a recent <a href="https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ice-law-enforcement-partners-arrest-370-alien-offenders-during-enhanced-operation">six-day ICE operation</a>.</p>

<p>After her arrest, Öztürk was held by ICE incommunicado for nearly 24 hours, her attorneys said, during which time she suffered the first of four asthma attacks. </p>

<p>Only later, through court filings and conversations with Öztürk, her attorneys learned that in the course of a single night she was taken from Massachusetts to New Hampshire and then Vermont, where the next morning, she was loaded onto a plane and flown to an ICE outpost in Alexandria, Louisiana.</p>

<p>Her last stop was a detention center in Basile about an hour away, where she remains, one of two dozen women in a damp, mouse-infested cell built to hold 14, according to court filings.</p>

<p>ICE officials say in <a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/ozturk-v-trump?document=Declaration-of-ICE-ERO-Acting-Deputy-Field-Office-Director#press-releases">court documents</a> they couldn’t find a bed for Öztürk in New England, adding that out-of-state transfers are “routinely conducted after arrest, due to operational necessity.”</p>

<p>Immigration attorneys say the late-night hopscotch was an ICE tactic to complicate jurisdiction and thwart legal attempts to stop Öztürk’s removal. Louisiana and Texas, they say, are favored destinations because the courts there are viewed as friendlier to the Trump administration’s MAGA agenda, issuing decisions limiting migrant rights.</p>

<p>“It was like a relay race, and she was the baton,” Öztürk’s attorney Mahsa Khanbabai said.</p>

“Whole Other Level of Terror”
<p>On March 4, two weeks before their spring break reunion, Öztürk texted her friend E. to say she’d been “doxxed” by Canary Mission, part of an array of shadowy, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/israel-gaza-student-protests-canary-mission.html">right-wing Jewish groups</a> that are criticized for using cherry-picked statements and distorted context to portray even mild criticism of Israel as antisemitism or support for terrorism.</p>

<p>For more than a decade, hard-line pro-Israel groups have publicized the names of pro-Palestinian activists, academics and students, often with scant or dubious “evidence” to back allegations of anti-Jewish bigotry. The goal, civil liberties advocates say, is to silence protesters through campaigns that have cost targets jobs and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2024/07/01/canary-mission-palestinian-protests/74222568007/">led to death threats</a>. On its website, Canary Mission said it is “motivated by a desire to combat” antisemitism on college campuses. It says it investigates individuals and groups “across the North American political spectrum, including the far-right, far-left and anti-Israel activists.”</p>

<p>The effort was stepped up during the wave of student protests that erupted in opposition to the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Öztürk’s entry on the Canary Mission site, posted in February, claims she “engaged in anti-Israel activism in 2024,” citing the <a href="https://www.tuftsdaily.com/article/2024/03/4ftk27sm6jkj">op-ed she co-wrote</a> more than a year ago that accused Tufts of ignoring students’ calls to divest from companies with ties to Israel over human rights concerns.</p>

<p>“I can not believe how much time people have,” Öztürk texted her friend when she saw the post.</p>

<p>E. responded with an open-mouthed “shocked” emoji. The Canary Mission entry, she said, had unlocked “a whole other level of terror” for Öztürk.</p>

<p>“It was that feeling of having your privacy be so violated — for people to spend all this time and energy on one op-ed,” E. said.</p>

<p>The op-ed published in The Tufts Daily was signed by four authors, including Öztürk, and endorsed by more than 30 other unnamed students. The language echoed the <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/04/1161816">statements of United Nations officials</a> and international war crimes investigators about the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/how-many-palestinians-has-israels-gaza-offensive-killed-2025-01-15/">death toll in Gaza</a>, which according to health officials there has passed 50,000, with about a third of the casualties under 18.</p>

<p>Öztürk, an advocate for children in communities plagued by violence, was personally heartsick over images of burned and mangled Palestinian children. But she was not a prominent activist or a fixture at campus protests, her friends and attorneys say.</p>

<p>Öztürk’s attorneys, who are scheduled to appear Monday before a federal judge in Vermont, say the sole basis for revoking her visa appears to be the op-ed highlighted by Canary Mission.</p>

<p>Ramzi Kassem, a lawyer representing Öztürk, said pro-Israel groups are providing the administration with lists of targets for its deportation campaign against noncitizen student protesters. “The sequence of events,” he said, “is op-ed, doxxing, detention.”</p>

<p>Pro-Israel groups, <a href="https://x.com/canarymission/status/1905262753264046392">including Canary Mission</a>, have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/03/29/zionist-palestinians-deportations-x/">boasted about their influence</a> on the Trump administration’s targeting of student protesters. Immigration officials insist that they make their own removal decisions based on a number of factors, including a hard line on criticism of Israel.</p>

<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/us/politics/rubio-immigration-students-ozturk-chung-khalil.html">says he has revoked</a> more than 300 student visas, including for Khalil and Öztürk, under the Immigration and Nationality Act, which permits the deportation of noncitizens who are deemed “adversarial to the foreign policy and national security interests” of the United States.</p>

<p>“We gave you a visa to come and study and get a degree, not to become a social activist who tears up our university campuses,” Rubio told a news conference last month in response to a question about Öztürk’s detention. “Every day I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visa.”</p>

<p>A spokesperson said the State Department does not comment on ongoing litigation.</p>

<p>In a call with reporters on Thursday, attorney Marc Van Der Hout of Khalil’s legal team said the authority Rubio cites was intended for rare occasions involving high-level diplomatic matters, “not to be used to go after people for First Amendment-protected activity.”</p>

Overnight Odyssey
<p>Surrounded by masked officers on March 25, Öztürk had no idea who was seizing her or where she was being taken, according to <a href="https://www.aclum.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/2025-04-10_petr_motion_for_release_return_ex_9_ozturk_82-10.pdf">a statement filed on Thursday</a> in federal court. The operatives were dressed in civilian clothes, she wrote, so at first she worried they were vigilantes spurred by Canary Mission.</p>

<p>“I had never seen police approach and take someone away like this,” she wrote. “I thought they were people who had doxxed me and I was afraid for my safety.”</p>

<p>Öztürk’s statement details her harrowing night being shuttled across New England with little food after a day of fasting for Ramadan. She describes being shackled by her feet and stomach and then driven to different sites for meetings with unidentified men, some in uniform and some not. One group so unsettled her, Öztürk wrote, that she “was sure they were going to kill me.”</p>

<p>At another stop, described in the statement as an isolated parking lot, Öztürk repeatedly asked an officer if she was in physical danger.</p>

<p>“He seemed to feel guilty and said ‘we are not monsters,’” Öztürk wrote.</p>

<p>At the last stop in Vermont, Öztürk wrote, she arrived famished and with “a lot of motion sickness from all the driving.” Officers took her biometric data and a DNA sample.</p>

<p>She would stay there for the night, in a cell with just a hard bench and a toilet. Officers gained access to her cellphone, she wrote, including personal photos of her without her religious headscarf.</p>

<p>“During the night they came to my cell multiple times and asked me questions about wanting to apply for asylum and if I was a member of a terrorist organization,” Öztürk wrote. “I tried to be helpful and answer their questions but I was so tired and didn’t understand what was happening to me.”</p>

<p>Around 4 the next morning, she wrote, she was shackled again in preparation for a trip to the airport. She was told the destination was Louisiana. Her statement to the court recounts the parting words of one of her jailers: “I hope we treated you with respect.”</p>

<p>At nearly every stage of her detention, Öztürk, who takes daily preventative medication for asthma, experienced asthma attacks, which she says are triggered by fumes, mold or stress, court files say.</p>

<p>During one in Louisiana, Öztürk wrote, a nurse took her temperature and said, “You need to take that thing off your head,” before removing her hijab without asking. When Öztürk protested, the nurse told her, “This is for your health.”</p>

<p>By her fourth wheezing episode, Öztürk wrote, she didn’t bother to seek attention from her jailers in Louisiana: “I didn’t feel safe at the medical center.”</p>

<p>After the portrait Öztürk paints of ICE detention, her statement turns back to her old life, a reminder of how abruptly her world has shifted. From her cell in Louisiana, she described the plans she had in the coming months. Completing her dissertation. A conference in Minnesota. Students to mentor. A summer class to teach.</p>

<p>“I want to return to Tufts to resume all of my cherished work,” she concluded.</p>

Reunion Interrupted
<p>Öztürk and E. bonded in 2018 after meeting at a Muslim study group in New York, where they were both attending Columbia University.</p>

<p>They were in their 20s then, two bookish cat lovers who were serious about their studies and their faith. They went on nature walks and liked afternoon naps.</p>

<p>“Old ladies,” E. said with a laugh.</p>

<p>They remained close and took turns visiting after Öztürk left for Tufts and E. moved away from the city. Over the years, the pressures of grad school and distance had made their visits less frequent, E. said, so they’d been looking forward to their three-day spring break catch-up.</p>

<p>During the visit, E. said, the women broke their fast together and visited a mosque for late-night Ramadan prayers. They stopped by a children’s library Öztürk wanted to visit. They stayed up late talking, gaming out how to keep Öztürk safe from the Trump administration’s crackdown.</p>

<p>“She said, ‘I think this is going to be the last time I get to visit you,’” E. recalled. “I told her, ‘No, no, you’re going to be able to come again, don’t worry, and I’m going to come visit you.’ That all turned out to be wrong.”</p>

<p>The friends had kept in touch daily after parting at the train station. They exchanged mundane texts and voice notes about doing taxes and eating cookies. E. sent Öztürk a photo of the park where they had walked during their visit. “Rümeysa! The trees are starting to bloom again,” she wrote.</p>

<p>They last texted on March 25, a couple hours before Öztürk was detained on the way to dinner in Somerville.</p>

<p>E. didn’t find out what happened until the next morning, when she stumbled out of bed before dawn for the early meal Muslims eat before the daily Ramadan fast. Sipping her tea, E. scrolled through her phone and spotted a message that said, “Have you seen this?” alongside an alert about Öztürk’s arrest.</p>

<p>“It was like: ‘Is this real? Am I still asleep?’” she recalled.</p>

<p>E. said the idea of her gentle friend being swept into ICE custody still didn’t seem real until later that morning, when the video was released and she saw a familiar figure, in the same white jacket she’d worn on her visit.</p>

<p>“It was utterly nauseating to watch,” E. said. “So horrifying and so heartbreaking to see her have to be so violently taken that way.”</p>

Trying to Be a “Good Detainee”
<p>Two days after Öztürk’s transfer to Louisiana, E. received a call from a strange number that came up on her phone as “Prison/Jail.” It was Öztürk, in the first of what would become regular check-ins at random times of the day.</p>

<p>In interviews, E. showed ProPublica corroborating photos, text messages and voice notes of her interactions with her friend.</p>

<p>“She always starts with, ‘Is this a good time to talk?’ And I’m, like, ‘I’ve been waiting for this,’” E. said.</p>

<p>Some days, Öztürk sounds upbeat. Turkish diplomats, she told E., had delivered her a new hijab. Öztürk found a cookbook and noted a citrus salad recipe she might try someday. She cracked jokes about being too old to climb into a bunk bed every night.</p>

<p>In one call, Öztürk expressed relief that she’d filed her taxes before getting detained — a perfect example, E. said, of her overachieving friend’s wry sense of humor.</p>

<p>“She read the detainee handbook two times,” E. said. “She said, ‘I’m trying to be a good detainee.’”</p>

<p>Other calls are not as easy, E. said, adding that she didn’t want to divulge specifics out of respect for her friend’s privacy. In those harder talks, E. said, she wishes she could “be there to tell her it’ll be OK, give her a hug.”</p>

<p>Their conversations are sprinkled with reminders that Öztürk’s nightmare might not end soon. She asked for help canceling appointments and returning library books. She’s also in the process of requesting a single paperback, per detention regulations.</p>

<p>If approved, she wants E. to find her a guide for writing children’s literature, preferably with exercises she could do from her cell. E. said her heart ached when Öztürk asked her to make the book a long one.</p>

<p>The calls and tasks ease feelings of helplessness, E. said, an antidote for the guilt that sneaks up on her when she walks outside on a sunny day.</p>

<p>“How is it that we’re moving forward,” she said, “while my closest friend is rotting in this place?”</p>

<p>On a late afternoon in November 2017, Witney Arch told her 1-1/2-year-old son to stop playing and come inside. Upset, he grabbed her right breast when she picked him up. She experienced a shock of pain but did not think it was anything serious. A week later, however, the ache had not subsided. After trips to several doctors, a biopsy revealed that Arch had early-stage breast cancer. Her surgeon told her that it was likely invasive and aggressive.</p>

<p>By the end of January, she had made two critical decisions. She would get a double mastectomy. And she wanted her operation at the Center for Restorative Breast Surgery in New Orleans, a medical facility renowned for its highly specialized approach to breast cancer care and reconstruction. The two surgeons who founded it had pioneered techniques that used a woman’s own body tissue to form new breasts post mastectomy. The idea of a natural restoration appealed to Arch. “I don’t judge anybody for getting implants, especially if you’ve had cancer,” she said. “But I felt like I was taking something foreign out of my body, cancer, and I did not want to put something foreign back in.”</p>

<p>Arch was a 42-year-old preschool teacher for her church, with four young children, living in a suburb of New Orleans. The 1-1/2-year-old had been born with Sturge-Weber syndrome, a rare neurological disorder. Caring for him consumed her life. By nature upbeat and optimistic, Arch felt blessed that her son’s act of defiance had led to an early diagnosis. “We’re going to pray about this and we’re going to figure it out,” she told her husband.</p>

<p>Arch asked her insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana, for approval to go to the center for her care, and the company granted it, a process known as prior authorization. Then, a week or so before her surgery, Arch was wrangling child care and meal plans when she got a call from the insurer. The representative on the line was trying to persuade her to have the surgery elsewhere. She urged Arch to seek a hospital that, unlike the center, was in network and charged less. “Do you realize how much this is going to cost?” Arch remembered the agent asking. Arch did not need more stress, but here it was — from her own health plan. “I feel very comfortable with my decision,” she replied. “My doctor teaches other doctors around the world how to do this.” Over the next year, Arch underwent five operations to rid herself of cancer and reconstruct her breasts.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            Witney Arch received authorization from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana for her mastectomy and breast restoration, but the insurer did not pay the full bill from the Center for Restorative Breast Surgery.

<p>Arch did not know it at the time, but her surgery would become evidence in a long-running legal fight between the breast center’s founders, surgeons Frank DellaCroce and Scott Sullivan, and Blue Cross, Louisiana’s biggest health insurance company, with an estimated two-thirds share of the market. DellaCroce and Sullivan had repeatedly sued the insurer, alleging that it granted approvals for surgery but then denied payments or paid only a fraction of patients’ bills. They pointed to calls like the one Arch received as proof of the company’s effort to drive away patients. The aggressive legal attack, they knew, was fraught. Litigation against the $3.4 billion company would take a long time and a lot of money. The chances of winning were slight. “You fight dragons at great peril,” DellaCroce would tell friends. But this September, after 18 years and several defeats in court, jurors found Blue Cross liable for fraud. They awarded the center $421 million — one of the largest verdicts ever to a single medical practice outside of a class-action lawsuit. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25893394-statement-from-blue-cross-and-blue-shield-of-louisiana/">In a statement</a>, Blue Cross said it “disagrees with the jury’s decision, which we believe was wrong on the facts and the law. We have filed an appeal and expect to be successful.”</p>

<p>Frustration with insurers is at an all-time high. The December fatal shooting of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson allegedly by Luigi Mangione serves as an extreme and tragic example. Doctors and insurers are locked into a perpetual conflict over health care costs, with patients caught in the middle. Doctors accuse insurance plans of blocking payments for health care treatments that can save the patients’ lives. Insurance companies insist they shouldn’t pay for procedures that they say are unnecessary or overpriced. It is easy to emerge from an examination of the American health care system with a cynicism that both sides are broken and corrupt.</p>

<p>However, interviews with scores of doctors, patients and insurance executives, as well as reviews of internal documents, regulatory filings and academic studies, reveal a fundamental truth: The two sides are not evenly matched. Insurance companies are players in the fight over money, and they are also the referees. Insurers produce their own guidelines to determine whether to pay claims. When a doctor appeals a denial, insurers make all the initial decisions. In legal settings, insurers are often given favorable standing in their ability to set what conditions they are required to cover. Federal and state insurance regulators lack the resources to pursue individual complaints against multibillion-dollar companies. Six major insurers, which include some of the nation’s largest companies, cover half of all Americans. They are pitted against tens of thousands of doctors’ practices and large hospital chains.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>The Blue Cross trial provides a rare opportunity to expose in detail the ways that health insurance companies wield power over doctors and their patients. Blue Cross executives testified that the breast center charged too much money — sometimes more than $180,000 for an operation. The center, they said, deserved special attention because it had a history of questionable charges. But the insurer’s defense went even further, to the very meaning of “prior authorization,” which it had granted women like Arch to pursue surgery. The authorization, they said in court, recognized that a procedure was medically necessary, but it also contained a clause that it was “<em>not</em> a guarantee of payment.” Blue Cross was not obliged to pay the center anything, top executives testified. “Let me be clear: The authorization never says we’re going to pay you,” said Steven Udvarhelyi, who was the CEO for the insurer from 2016 to 2024, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25882446-steven-udvarhelyi-deposition/#document/p1/a2630959">in a deposition</a>. “That’s why there’s a disclaimer.</p>

<p>From 2015 through 2023, the Baton Rouge-based insurer paid, on average, less than 9% of the charges billed by the breast center for more than 7,800 individual medical procedures — even though it had authorized all of them. Thousands of such claims were never paid at all, according to court records. Testimony revealed that the health plan never considered thousands of appeals filed by the center. Corporate documents showed Blue Cross executives had set up secret processes for approving operations and reimbursing the clinic and its doctors that resulted in reduced fees and payment delays. One lucrative strategy: A national-level policy allowed Blue Cross Louisiana to take a cut of any savings it achieved in paying the breast center on behalf of patients covered by out-of-state Blue Cross companies, meaning the less the insurer paid out, the more it earned.</p>

<p>In Sullivan’s words, the insurer was hypocritical, “morally bankrupt.” Blue Cross had stranded many of the center’s patients with high bills, amounts that it had absorbed over the years. On several occasions, though, Blue Cross executives had signed special one-time deals with the center, known as single case agreements, to pay for their wives’ cancer treatment. To Sullivan, it seemed the insurer was willing to pay the center when patients had connections but would fight when patients did not.</p>

<p>Blue Cross declined to comment on any individual cases but said in a statement that single case agreements were “common in the industry” and were available to all members when needed to access out-of-network providers.</p>

<p>Nobody would take <a href="https://www.breastcenter.com/">the breast center and its adjoining hospital</a> as an ordinary medical establishment. The two facilities take up a city block along St. Charles Avenue, the thoroughfare famous for its streetcars, Mardi Gras parades and Queen Anne mansions. Patients access the complex — created by merging a former law office, funeral home, car dealership and Dunkin’ Donuts — by driving around back where a porte cochere leads into a soaring atrium. Light pours in through windows set in the high ceiling. Arrangements of white orchids are scattered among comfortable couches and chairs. Here, women consult with doctors to plan their treatment. Surgeries are performed at the 39-bed hospital, which has an Icee machine in a family room. New-age music plays softly throughout the building. Rooms are designed to be as homey as possible, with medical gear hidden away and seascapes by a local artist hanging on the wall. One patient’s husband referred to it as a “spa-spital.”</p>

<p>The idea of combining the luxury feel of an upscale plastic surgery practice with the mission-driven zeal of a medical clinic came to DellaCroce and Sullivan while they were young surgeons. The two grew up in Louisiana. Sullivan spent much of his childhood in Mandeville, a suburb of New Orleans on the north side of Lake Ponchartrain, his dad employed in the oil and gas industry. His mother wanted him to be a priest or a doctor. “I definitely was not going to become a priest,” he said. DellaCroce’s father worked at the paper mill in West Monroe in the state’s northern neck. His mother, a nurse, gave him an appreciation for medicine as a career that was “meaningful and challenging.”</p>

<p>They became friends while working at the Louisiana State University medical center, where they earned the nickname “the Sushi Brothers” for their favorite lunch. They were drawn to microsurgery and breast reconstruction because it was an emerging field that was innovating and improving care. Both men became board-certified in plastic surgery. Sullivan, 60, is the hard-charging businessman, stocky, direct and blunt. DellaCroce, 58, with a ponytail, goatee and soft drawl, is more the diplomat, patient and cerebral. The pair have lectured around the world and written numerous medical journal articles.</p>

<p>They opened their first office in 2003 in a single room rented from a fellow doctor at what was then known as Memorial Medical Center, the hulking private hospital in New Orleans. They performed operations at facilities throughout the region but found that most gave little consideration to their patients’ comfort. They wanted to build a different kind of hospital. “Can we give them that little bit of extra without breaking the budget to make the experience less awful? Can’t make it great, but can you make it less awful?” DellaCroce explained. “Can you attend to the human side of this patient and give them the added value of peace and confidence?” Hurricane Katrina set back their construction plans, and the new edifice, named the St. Charles Surgical Hospital, did not open its doors until 2009. It boasts of being the only hospital in the country devoted solely to care for breast cancer patients who have received mastectomies. The center does not provide radiation or chemotherapy treatments. The majority of patients come from out of state.</p>

<p>Women seeking to have their breasts restored after a mastectomy face two paths. Some choose a relatively straightforward surgical procedure using implants filled with silicone or another gel. The center specializes in the other option, what’s known as autologous tissue reconstruction, where a woman’s own fat is taken from one part of the body, like the bottom or the stomach, and used to rebuild the breast. The procedure requires a longer recovery time, but the new breasts become part of the body.</p>

<p>The transplant surgery is lengthy and complex. Operations can last up to 12 hours with big medical teams involved. One surgeon performs the mastectomy while another creates a new breast by knitting together layers of fat and tissue. Concentration is intense. The surgeons stare through glasses with microscopes to connect new blood vessels with a needle that’s thinner than an eyelash, using thread less than half the width of a human hair. DellaCroce and Sullivan invented techniques, for example, allowing tissue to be taken from multiple sites when a woman did not have enough fat in one part of her body for a full restoration.</p>

<p>One afternoon last fall, DellaCroce strode into a cavernous operating room to check on a patient. On the table in front of him, a woman lay covered in curtains of blue surgical cloth, only her torso exposed. Earlier in the day, a surgical oncologist had removed her right breast as part of a mastectomy to treat her cancer. Later, another surgeon had taken flaps of fat from her stomach and interlaced them with blood vessels to create a new breast to replace the lost one. Now, in the fifth hour of surgery, a physician’s assistant leaned over her midsection, closing an incision along her side with some final stitches. Nurses hurried around the space, preparing to wrap up the operation. Paul Simon’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq-gYOrU8bA">You Can Call Me Al</a>” played in the background. The smell of burnt flesh hung in the air. A blue light signaled that the new arteries were successfully pumping blood. “Wow, that woman looks really good,” DellaCroce told the physician’s assistant. “Nice job.”</p>

<p>There is no denying that the center’s high-end treatment means high costs. The median charge for an operation and hospital stay is about $165,000. DellaCroce and Sullivan hired consultants to review other well-regarded practices, who advised them their prices were competitive with their peers. “We weren’t asking to be paid LeBron James, best of the best, even though we feel we’re in the top 1 or 2% of the country,” Sullivan said. “We just wanted something fair.”</p>

<p>It is one of the quirks of the American health care system that insurers almost never pay the prices for procedures demanded by doctors and hospitals.</p>

<p>To understand why requires a tour of the grand bargain at the heart of the health insurance system. Insurance companies negotiate with hospitals and doctors to discount reimbursements on medical procedures, like office visits or MRI scans. Providers who sign these contracts are in network. Insurance companies like in-network doctors because they can budget for health expenses and set premiums accordingly. Doctors and hospitals agree to be in network because they get a steady stream of insured patients.</p>

<p>DellaCroce and Sullivan held contracts with insurers that resulted in average payments to the center’s doctors in the $20,000 to $30,000 range. But DellaCroce and Sullivan never came to an agreement with Blue Cross. That made them an exception in Louisiana — the insurer is so dominant that 97% of local physicians and hospitals are in network. DellaCroce and Sullivan said the company was not offering them enough money — in some cases not even enough to cover the cost of the surgeries, they argued in court documents. The doctors and their hospital remained out of network, meaning they charged Blue Cross the full price for their procedures.</p>

<p>Such charges are controversial. Insurance companies and many health experts say they are too often inflated and untethered from actual costs. Physicians and hospitals say their fees are justified, reflecting the true price of medical care. In the end, insurers — especially in states like Louisiana, with few competitors — use their market power in negotiations to set reimbursements at what they want to pay, not what doctors charge.</p>

<p>At Blue Cross, Dwight Brower was charged with reviewing the bills from the breast center. He had worked as a physician at a small family practice in Baton Rouge and then at a local hospital before joining Blue Cross as a medical director. He helped oversee prior authorizations. While many patients assume that an approval means an insurer will pay for an operation, it is simply a recognition that a procedure is medically necessary. Federal law mandates that private insurers cover breast restorations for women who undergo mastectomies because of cancer or genetic risk. And patients, in general, are allowed to choose their own doctors.</p>

<p>However, since the center was out of network and had no contract with the insurer, Blue Cross determined how much it would pay for the treatment, and Brower believed that the breast center’s bills were exorbitant. “I did not think that they were reasonable,” <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537636-2024-09-13-st-charles-20240913-am/?mode=document#document/p47/a2630973">he would later testify</a>. Surgeons doing lung transplants or brain surgery rarely billed Blue Cross more than $50,000 for their work. Why should DellaCroce and Sullivan get so much more? “Don’t get me wrong. The surgeons at the center are extremely skilled,” he acknowledged. The operations were often lengthy. “But so are open-heart surgeries,” he said. “Relative to some of the other extremely complicated surgeries done by other surgeons in other areas of the body, it just seemed like their fee schedule was extremely high.”</p>

<p>Blue Cross Louisiana executives testified that they did not even consider doctors’ invoices when making decisions on what to reimburse because such charges were “unregulated” and “nonstandard.” Instead, they paid “<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25555648-2017-12-04-blue-cross-blue-shield-payment-for-out-of-network-providers/">an amount we establish</a>” — unless the doctor’s bill was cheaper. In the end, the insurer said it settled on reimbursing the breast center about the same as in-network doctors performing similar operations, even though DellaCroce and Sullivan did not benefit from having patients referred to them. In practice, that meant the insurer paid out a fraction of the breast center’s bills. Of the 7,837 medical procedures in dispute in the lawsuit, involving 1,680 patients, Blue Cross paid about $43 million on invoices totaling $500 million. Some 60% of the claims weren’t reimbursed at all. The difference between the bill and the payment could be striking. For example, in the case of Arch, Blue Cross paid $8,580 out of $102,722 for one operation. For another, it paid $3,190 out of $34,975.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        <p>Fundamentally, I think their problem was that we were doctors who had control. That was regarded as a threat.</p>

<p>Executives said the Blue Cross reimbursements were fair, designed to keep premiums low for the nearly 2 million Louisianans who depended on the insurer to cover their health care. Paying the breast center’s full fees would add to its customers’ burden, they said. “If we were to just agree to any rates or any prices set by physicians or any providers, it would cause cost to be exorbitantly high for both the plan and for members particularly, because we wouldn’t be able to forecast or make sure those plans are actually sound,” <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537645-208c471/#document/p5/a2630982">said</a> Curtis Anders, the vice president of provider networks for Blue Cross. “Premiums would increase.”</p>

<p>For many out-of-network doctors, payments lower than their invoices are an infuriating part of doing business. They absorb the costs, or pass them on to their patients, a practice known as balance billing that can result in medical debt. DellaCroce and Sullivan were the rare physicians with the tenacity to fight. The center collected money from both insurers and patients — but it carried the unpaid portion of invoices on its books. That amount grew every year as it battled Blue Cross.</p>

<p>DellaCroce and Sullivan were convinced that Blue Cross had singled them out for their obstreperousness, but they had no proof. Then, during a phone call one day, an employee for the center was talking to a Blue Cross representative to obtain a prior authorization. The representative let slip that the request required special handling. The breast center’s doctors were flagged on an internal roster. It was called the targeted list.</p>

        Discoveries
    
        
    
                    
<p>On Dec. 8, 2023, several dozen attorneys and paralegals from Chehardy Sherman Williams, one of New Orleans’ top law firms, were celebrating their annual holiday party. They had gathered in a private dining room with gilded mirrors and shimmering chandeliers at Arnaud’s restaurant, a bastion of Creole cuisine in the heart of the French Quarter. The waiters served shrimp remoulade, prime rib and turtle soup. Small talk filled the air.</p>

<p>Suddenly, several attorneys’ cellphones buzzed as they all received the same email, a message from the lawyers for Blue Cross. It contained discovery for the case, more than 42,000 pages of internal documents, emails and policies. Matthew Sherman, one of the attorneys representing the center, turned to a colleague. “Can you believe this?” he asked. It was like something from a John Grisham novel, the kind of thing he and his friends had joked about at law school, a document dump at Christmas time. By long tradition, many of New Orleans’ biggest law firms hold their holiday parties on the same Friday afternoon in December. Afterward, rival attorneys from around town gather for drinks under a flag of truce at a local bar. Sherman realized there would be no afterparty this year. Nor much of a holiday vacation.</p>

<p>The delivery of the documents was a Christmas gift nearly 20 years in the making. DellaCroce and Sullivan’s <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25883705-2006-6487-crbs-v-bcbs-early-lawsuit/">first lawsuits</a> against Blue Cross, involving 88 breach-of-contract claims filed in a Louisiana civil court beginning in 2006, were dismissed because of a federal court ruling regarding jurisdiction. A <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25883734-2010-04-06-2010-03356-crbs-v-bcbsla-complaint/">second lawsuit</a>, which lasted from 2010 through 2017, resulted in limited discovery and a two-day trial in federal court. Jurors found that Blue Cross had failed to tell the center how much it would pay for procedures, but they also ruled the center had not been financially harmed. A judge dismissed the remaining claims.</p>

<p>DellaCroce and Sullivan launched their <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537857-2019-10-10-3rd-amended-complaint/">third lawsuit</a> in February 2017 with a novel legal theory: They accused Blue Cross of fraud. They contended that for years the insurer had issued prior authorizations without the intention of paying the actual bills. Their lawyers had sought the targeted list during discovery to help prove the case. Blue Cross denied it existed.</p>

<p>But now, as Sherman and fellow attorney Patrick Follette began poring over the thousands of documents, they came upon a spreadsheet that said “<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537631-2024-09-06-am-st-charles-surgical-20240906-am/?mode=document#document/p56/a2624531">Targeted Provider List</a>.” The first names on the list were DellaCroce and Sullivan. It was labeled “confidential” and dated June 2007 — about a year after the pair had filed their first lawsuit against Blue Cross alleging nonpayment. More digging turned up other documents. There was a “blocked” list that also featured the two doctors.</p>

<p>A corporate policy document provided what DellaCroce and Sullivan considered the most revealing explanation for Blue Cross’ financial motivation. Blue Cross insurers are independent companies that operate under a common set of rules, similar to franchisees in a fast-food chain. When a person covered by Blue Cross in their home state receives treatment in another state, the Blue Cross where the treatment occurs pays the provider and then recoups the cost from the home-state plan. What the attorneys discovered was that Blue Cross Louisiana would receive a share of any savings it could generate for the home-state plan. Say, for instance, Blue Cross Alabama was facing a bill of $5,000 for a procedure. If Blue Cross Louisiana instead paid $1,000, it saved the Alabama plan $4,000. The policy allowed Blue Cross Louisiana <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537637-20736f1/?mode=document#document/p36/a2631133">to earn 16% of the savings</a> — in this scenario, $640.</p>

<p>For DellaCroce and Sullivan, the revelations cemented their belief that Blue Cross was a bad corporate actor more interested in power and control than health care. The percentage fee incentivized the insurer to pay the doctors as little as possible. The bigger the savings, the more Blue Cross made. “It’s win-win,” DellaCroce said. “That’s their pay day.”</p>

<p>As the trial approached, Blue Cross attempted to settle the case. DellaCroce and Sullivan refused the offer as too low.</p>

        The Trial
    
        
    
                    
<p>On the afternoon of Sept. 5, 2024, the case — St. Charles Surgical Hospital, L.L.C. and Center for Restorative Breast Surgery, L.L.C. v. Louisiana Health Service &amp; Indemnity Company D/B/A Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Louisiana, Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Louisiana, Inc. and HMO Louisiana, Inc. — opened in Division C of the Orleans Parish Civil District Court, a high-ceilinged room with dark brown benches and tables, fake marble columns and fluorescent lights. James Williams, the chief litigator for the hospital, had already impressed the 45 potential jurors by memorizing all their names and backgrounds during jury selection. Now, he stood up and placed a football on the plaintiff’s table in front of the 12 chosen to try the case, which included a third grade teacher, a movie stunt double and a hotel manager. He warned them that they would hear a lot of “insurance talk” from Blue Cross. “I’m going to ask you, ladies and gentlemen on the jury, keep your eye on the ball. Keep your eye on what this case is about,” Williams told them. “If they start saying things like, ‘Well, oh, we paid them what we thought was fair, 9%,’ keep your eye on the ball, right?”</p>

<p>Over 10 days — interrupted by a two-day break to allow a hurricane to pass across Louisiana — Williams made his case that Blue Cross had defrauded his clients by making promises to pay but failing to deliver.</p>

<p>Much of Blue Cross’ defense had relied on the notice that a prior authorization was no guarantee of payment. The insurer had not committed fraud, it said, since it never explicitly promised the center to reimburse anything. Udvarhelyi, the former CEO, had insisted on that. But on the stand, Blue Cross witnesses provided a more nuanced explanation. They acknowledged that the disclaimer was not meant as a general excuse to free the company from paying bills. A prior authorization “usually” resulted in a payment, testified Brower, who reviewed the center’s bills. He said that the notice was intended for specific situations. For instance, Blue Cross would not cover a woman who dropped out of her insurance before the operation. Nor would it pay anything if a patient had not met her deductible. But otherwise, Brower said, Blue Cross intended to compensate for a procedure that it had authorized. “It’s inappropriate for us as a company to approve a code and then turn around and deny it,” <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537637-20736f1/?mode=document#document/p13/a2624462">Brower said</a>.</p>

<p>Over the years, the center had appealed thousands of reimbursements for being too low. It hired additional employees to manage the paperwork. At the trial, Blue Cross revealed that it had never considered any of the appeals — nor had it ever told the center that they were pointless. “An appeal is not available to review an underpayment,” <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537645-208c471/#document/p37/a2630979">acknowledged</a> Paula Shepherd, a Blue Cross executive vice president. The insurer simply issued an edict — the payment was correct.</p>

<p>This was the core of the case. The insurer set the rules. The insurer set the prices. Doctors could appeal to a state insurance regulator. But if that failed, and it often did, the only recourse was a long, costly lawsuit.</p>

<p>Williams <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537630-2024-02/?mode=document#document/p27/a2631151">summed up</a> for the jury the center’s treatment at the hands of Blue Cross: “Our payments are slow pay, low pay or no pay.”</p>

<p>In countering those arguments, Blue Cross witnesses explained that the insurer was committed to paying for Louisianans’ health care and keeping costs low. As a nonprofit, it directed any excess revenue from operations back into the business. (Udvarhelyi, the CEO, did acknowledge that his salary, over $1 million, included bonuses that depended on hitting revenue targets and increasing membership.)</p>

<p>Brian West, a Blue Cross executive who monitored payments, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537635-2024-09-10-st-charles-20240910/?mode=document#document/p14/a2631153">said the center</a> had engaged in “egregious” billing practices. “They are bad actors in the billing world,” he said. But company witnesses offered only a handful of examples. Sometimes the center mistakenly coded its bills in a way that appeared to charge for four separate breast reconstructions in a single operation. In other cases, the center asked for payment for two surgeons in the room at the same time. But Blue Cross, following Medicare guidelines, would pay two surgeons only 20% more than the reimbursement for a single surgeon.</p>

<p>Blue Cross did not accuse the center of any intentional miscoding — but the sloppy billing led to additional scrutiny, the company’s witnesses said. The targeted list, a witness testified, had been created especially for the center, requiring all prior authorization requests to bypass normal routes for a special review by company doctors. The blocked list meant that each bill from the center received a manual scrub by payment specialists before reimbursement. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537635-2024-09-10-st-charles-20240910/#document/p17/a2631155">Blue Cross acknowledged</a> the careful checking often resulted in the need for more information from the center, which could result in slower processing of claims. But the lists, executives insisted, were not designed to reduce payments. “Basically, no harm was done,” <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537634-2058691/#document/p55/a2631154">said</a> Becky Juncker, who was involved in approving surgical procedures.</p>

<p>Company witnesses explained that the 16% received in saving money for out-of-state Blue Cross insurers was a fee to cover the costs of handling adjustments of the claim — though they were not able to explain why Blue Cross did not charge a flat fee for its services.</p>

<p>Blue Cross also defended itself against the accusation that it had paid nothing for 60% of the charges for individual procedures. Witnesses said the insurer had followed industry practice in bundling charges to make a single payment for an operation. An attorney for the center noted that it had never agreed to take bundled payments — Blue Cross had imposed them.</p>

<p>As to the calls to women like Arch? That was an effort to save members money. “Our medical area would reach out to our members who were utilizing out-of-network providers to help them understand the, I would say, the financial implications,” said Shepherd, the Blue Cross executive vice president, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25892223-2023-12-11-paula-shepherd-depo/?mode=document#document/p1/a2631176">in a deposition</a>. “It could be financially catastrophic to a member to have an out-of-network claim that they are financially responsible for. It’s a huge difference.”</p>

<p>In summing up the case, Kim Boyle, the lead attorney for the company, told jurors that Blue Cross had not committed fraud. It had acted to ensure the company and its members paid a fair price for the center’s services, she said. “There’s no scheme. There’s no plot. There’s no mafia. There are no Blue Cross employees of Louisiana that are sitting in some smoke-filled room in Baton Rouge, plotting against these plaintiffs on St. Charles Avenue in New Orleans,” Boyle said. “It’s fiction; it’s fancy; it’s completely made up.”</p>

<p>On Sept. 20, at 1:57 p.m., Judge Sidney H. Cates IV sent the jurors to deliberate. The center attorneys retreated to a nearby hotel to await the verdict. About two hours later, they were summoned back to Division C. Williams put his head down and swore. He worried that such a quick return in the legally complex case meant victory for Blue Cross.</p>

<p>The center’s lawyers paid close attention to Cates as he reviewed the jurors’ decision. It was a two-page form. If the jurors found in favor of Blue Cross, the judge would have no reason to read on. Cates flipped to the second page: The jurors had found Blue Cross liable for fraud. “Please express in dollars the total monetary compensation, if any, Blue Cross owes the hospital and the center for the damages,” Cates said, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25892343-2024-09-27-jury-form-with-verdict/?mode=document">reading from the verdict</a>. “Net damages, $421,488,633.” The center’s lawyers stood and shook hands as the insurer’s attorneys prepared to leave the courtroom.</p>

<p>DellaCroce was in surgery at the hospital, having expected a longer deliberation. Sullivan was in the courtroom to hear the verdict. Afterward, jurors approached and thanked him for his work. He teared up. “We would have given more if we had been asked for more. That’s how egregious the fraud was,” Juliet Laughlin, a 58-year-old property manager who served as forewoman, later said. “There had been wrong done.”</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p>Blue Cross has appealed the verdict. A health insurance trade group has warned that the finding sets a dangerous precedent. If allowed to stand, insurance companies in Louisiana may find themselves forced to pay whatever price is demanded by out-of-network doctors — which in turn could raise health insurance premiums across the state, the Louisiana Association of Health Plans said in a statement.</p>

<p>For DellaCroce and Sullivan, the verdict was vindication. They had refused to sign contracts they thought unfair. They had rejected settlement offers they thought too low. The trial had revealed Blue Cross’ domineering behavior. “Fundamentally, I think their problem was that we were doctors who had control,” DellaCroce said. “That was regarded as a threat.”</p>

<p>In the months since the judgment, Blue Cross has not changed its practices, the doctors said. It has not approached with an offer that would bring the hospital in network. It still issues prior authorizations for women’s surgeries. And it still pays only a fraction of the billed fees.</p>

<p>Federal scientists responsible for monitoring the health of West Coast fisheries are cleaning office bathrooms and reconsidering critical experiments after the Department of Commerce failed to renew their lab’s contracts for hazardous waste disposal, janitorial services, IT and building maintenance.</p>

<p>Trash is piling up at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, staffers told ProPublica. Ecologists, chemists and biologists at Montlake Laboratory, the center’s headquarters in Seattle, are taking turns hauling garbage to the dumpster and discussing whether they should create a sign-up sheet to scrub toilets.</p>

<p>The scientists — who conduct genetic sampling of endangered salmon to check the species’ stock status and survival — routinely work with chemicals that can burn skin, erupt into flames and cause cancer. At least one said they’d have to delay mission-critical research if hazardous waste removal isn’t restored.</p>

<p>The deteriorating conditions at Montlake stem from a new policy at the Commerce Department that says Secretary Howard Lutnick must personally approve all contracts over $100,000. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/09/nx-s1-5356166/noaa-contracts-reviewed-one-by-one">NPR reported that the bottleneck</a> has disrupted operations at many NOAA facilities.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>ProPublica spoke to three Montlake employees who described what it was like to work there as, one by one, service contracts expire and aren’t renewed. People are running around looking for compost bags and wondering who will empty out the female sanitary waste containers in the bathrooms, they said. The floors are getting dirty and workers have no access to vacuums or mops. Some scientists have bought their own soap and cleaning supplies.</p>

<p>Nor can people escape by working from home: the Trump administration has increasingly ordered federal workers to return to the office five days a week. At Montlake, that policy will apply to everyone by April 21.</p>

<p>“It’s making our work unsafe, and it’s unsanitary for any workplace,” but especially an active laboratory full of fire-reactive chemicals and bacteria, one Montlake researcher said.</p>

<p>Press officers at NOAA, the Commerce Department and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Montlake employees were informed last week that a contract for safety services — which includes the staff who move laboratory waste off-campus to designated disposal sites — would lapse after April 9, leaving just one person responsible for this task. Hazardous waste “pickups from labs may be delayed,” employees were warned in a recent email.</p>

<p>The building maintenance team’s contract expired Wednesday, which decimated the staff that had handled plumbing, HVAC and the elevators. Other contacts lapsed in late March, leaving the Seattle lab with zero janitorial staff and a skeleton crew of IT specialists.</p>

<p>During a big staff meeting at Montlake on Wednesday, lab leaders said they had no updates on when the contracts might be renewed, one researcher said. They also acknowledged it was unfair that everyone would need to pitch in on janitorial duties on top of their actual jobs.</p>

<p>Nick Tolimieri, a union representative for Montlake employees, said the problem is “all part of the large-scale bullying program” to push out federal workers. It seems like every Friday “we get some kind of message that makes you unable to sleep for the entire weekend,” he said. Now, with these lapsed contracts, it’s getting “more and more petty.”</p>

<p>The problems, large and small, at Montlake provide a case study of the chaos that’s engulfed federal workers across many agencies as the Trump administration has fired staff, dumped contracts and eliminated long-time operational support. Yesterday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/10/noaa-firings-trump">hundreds of NOAA workers who had been fired in February</a>, then briefly reinstated, were fired again. </p>

<p>Local management had new service contracts ready to go ages ago, Tolimieri said. The delay from headquarters means employees will struggle to get repairs for their computers or basic building maintenance; the aging elevators at Montlake already break so often that Tolimieri joked it would be easier to send notices on the occasions when they did work.</p>

<p>The fisheries center employs more than 350 people, most of whom work at Montlake. The rest are scattered across several research stations in Oregon and Washington.</p>

<p>Staff at the center conduct research and provide scientific advice for policies on sustainable fishing and endangered species, including a population of orcas in Puget Sound. They test seafood after oil spills to ensure the fish are safe to eat. Their work helps restore native salmon populations and support regional farming.</p>

<p>NOAA is “so uncontroversial,” said the Montlake researcher who’s worried about hazardous waste disposal. Employees are just “trying to do weather reports and give people good seafood.”</p>

<p>The researcher said lab workers are trained in basic lab safety, so the chemicals are properly stored, handled and placed into appropriate waste containers after use. But there’s a limit to how much chemical waste can be kept on site. And the contractors who left were experts on handling emergencies like large chemical spills or serious toxic exposures.</p>

<p>If those contractors don’t return soon, the researcher said, the lab may need to delay or pause important research.</p>

<p>That could include chemical-intensive lab work like testing sea lions, killer whales and walruses from Alaska for environmental contaminants, Tolimieri said.</p>

<p>“For a bunch of people who are screaming about efficiency,” he said, referring to the administration’s efforts to downsize the federal government, “they’ve done the most inefficient things possible.”</p>

Title    : Beyond Showerheads: Trump’s Attempts to Kill Appliance Regulations Cause Chaos

<p>Donald Trump makes no secret of his loathing for regulations that limit water and energy use by home appliances. For years, he has regaled supporters at his campaign rallies with fanciful stories about their impact. He is so exercised by the issue that, even as global stock markets convulsed Wednesday in response to his tariff plans, Trump took time out to issue an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/maintaining-acceptable-water-pressure-in-showerheads/">executive order titled “Maintaining Acceptable Water Pressure in Showerheads.”</a></p>

<p>Contemporary shower fixtures are only one of the items that rankle the president, who complains that “there’s no water coming and you end up standing there five times longer,” making it difficult to coif his “perfect” hair. He has frequently denounced dishwashers that he claims take so long and clean so poorly that “the electric bill is ten times more than the water”; toilets that require flushing “ten or 15 times”; and LED lightbulbs, which he faults for making him look orange.</p>

<p>In his first term, Trump pursued an array of gimmicks to try to undermine the rules. His moves were opposed by industry and environmental groups alike. If it’s possible for regulations to be popular, these ones are. They have cut America’s water and energy consumption, reduced global-warming emissions and saved consumers money. Legal prohibitions stymied most of Trump’s maneuvers back then, and the Biden administration quickly reversed the steps Trump managed to take.</p>

<p>Trump’s executive order on showerheads <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/us/politics/trump-showers-water-pressure.html">generated headlines</a>, but it’s likely to have little effect (more on that later). Far more consequential steps have been taken outside the Oval Office.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>With the aid of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency team, Trump appears to be attempting an end run that could succeed where his past attempts failed: by simply terminating the consulting contract that the Department of Energy relies on to develop and enforce the rules. In late March, DOGE’s “wall of receipts” stated that it had “deleted” a Department of Energy contract for Guidehouse LLP (a PricewaterhouseCoopers spinoff) for “Appliance Standards Analysis and Regulatory Support Service,” producing a listed savings of $247,603,000. That item has now disappeared from the DOGE website, and its current status remains unclear.</p>

<p>This has produced confusion for everyone from appliance manufacturers to government officials to the contractors paid to enforce the rules. If the contract is indeed canceled, experts told ProPublica, it would cripple the government’s efficiency standards program, which relies on the consulting firm’s technical expertise and testing labs to update standards, ensure compliance and punish violators.</p>

<p>“It would have a huge impact,” said George Washington University law professor Emily Hammond, who helped run the program as deputy general counsel at the Department of Energy and now serves on its appliance standards advisory committee. “DOE does not have the internal capacity to do that work. Taking that away pulls the rug out from under the agency’s ability to run that regulatory program.”</p>

<p>Appliance manufacturers seem almost as concerned. “This is not a positive development,” said Josh Greene, vice president for government affairs at A.O. Smith, the largest manufacturer of water heaters in the U.S. Terminating the Guidehouse contract, he said, would create “a wild Wild West” where “upstart manufacturers” are free to import poor-quality products because “they know there’s no one to enforce the rules. That’s not good for American manufacturing and it’s not good for consumers.”</p>

<p>The Department of Energy has made no public attempts to clarify the matter. An agency spokesperson did not respond to ProPublica’s requests for comment. Emails to DOGE and the White House brought no reply. And Guidehouse officials, reportedly eager to lay low, also offered no response to multiple requests for comment.</p>

<p>The government’s efficiency requirements originated with the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, signed into law in 1975, when the concern was an energy shortage, not global warming. Today, the Department of Energy is required to set rules for energy and water use by more than 70 appliances and commercial products sold in the U.S. The agency must consider imposing stricter standards for each product every eight years, based on what is “technologically feasible and economically justified.” Manufacturers then have three to five years to make their products measure up.</p>

<p>The Energy Department typically stiffens a requirement only after years of study, comment, negotiation and testing (and sometimes litigation) among industry, consumer and environmental groups. The law also includes an “anti-backsliding” provision that bars relaxation of standards that have been finalized. Guidehouse and its subcontractors have for years performed virtually all the necessary technical work; they also maintain <a href="https://www.regulations.doe.gov/">a certification database</a> that U.S. authorities use to keep illegal products from being imported.</p>

<p>Republican lawmakers, anti-regulation advocates and right-wing media have long decried the efficiency rules as an impingement on personal freedom, limiting product choice. The early rollout of water-throttling products produced some of the issues Trump complains about, lampooned in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUt6BWeL1GE">1996 “Seinfeld” episode</a> titled “The Shower Head.”</p>

<p>But in the decades since, the standards have been widely embraced, dramatically cutting energy and water consumption, reducing emissions and providing plenty of attractive consumer choices. In 2023, <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/home-garden/showerheads/buying-guide/">Consumer Reports</a> found that “even the simplest and least expensive showerheads can provide a satisfying shower.” <a href="https://advocacy.consumerreports.org/press_release/consumer-reports-new-dishwasher-standards-will-help-consumers-save-money-on-energy-bills-while-ensuring-shoppers-have-good-choices-that-perform-well/">Dishwashers</a> and <a href="https://www.consumerreports.org/washing-machines/yes-your-washing-machine-is-using-enough-water/">clothes washers</a> clean better while using less than half as much water and energy as they once did. The transition to LED light bulbs, nearly complete, is estimated to have cut energy bills by $3 billion a year and eliminated the need <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-solutions/2022/04/26/biden-incandescent-lightbulb-ban-trump/">for about 30 large power plants</a>.</p>

<p>In January, days before Trump returned to office, a <a href="https://eta.lbl.gov/publications/energy-and-economic-impacts-us">Department of Energy report</a> estimated that the efficiency standards are now saving the average American household about $576 a year on their utility bills, while cutting the nation’s energy consumption by 6.5% and water consumption by 12%. A 2022 survey by the Consumer Federation of America found that <a href="https://consumerfed.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Appliance-Survey-Issue-Brief.pdf">76% of Americans</a> support the government setting efficiency standards for appliances.</p>

<p>None of that has slowed Trump’s attacks. During his first term, the Department of Energy ignored legal deadlines for considering efficiency updates on 28 products, blocked the long-planned rollout of new lightbulb rules and sought to bypass finalized appliance standards through byzantine legal maneuvers. Among other things, the Energy Department announced special new “product classes” for dishwashers, clothes washers and dryers that completed their “normal” cycle in an hour or less. This would exempt any such “short-cycle” devices that were introduced from the existing limits on water and energy use.</p>

<p>Manufacturers never brought those models to market. Most existing appliances already had a “short cycle” option that did their job well; those short on time simply had to push that button. And by mid-2022, Biden’s Energy Department had reversed Trump’s regulatory moves. The department went on to issue an array of tightened home appliance rules <a href="https://appliance-standards.org/document/agreement-home-appliance-efficiency-standards-will-preserve-consumer-features-and-deliver">jointly recommended</a> by industry and consumer groups; most were finalized early enough to be immune from congressional rollback.</p>

<p>This didn’t stop Trump from boasting on the 2024 campaign trail that he had changed everything during his first term. He vowed to fix it all again when he returned to the White House. “Eliminate energy efficiency standards for appliances” was on Project 2025’s list of “needed reforms.”</p>

<p>Sure enough, on his first day back in the White House, Trump issued two executive orders targeting the efficiency rules. On Feb. 11, he posted on Truth Social: “I am hereby instructing Secretary Lee Zeldin to immediately go back to my Environmental Orders, which were terminated by Crooked Joe Biden, on Water Standard and Flow pertaining to SINKS, SHOWERS, TOLIETS, WASHING MACHINES, DISHWASHERS, etc., and to likewise go back to the common sense standards on LIGHTBULBS, that were put in place by the Trump Administration, but terminated by Crooked Joe. I look forward to signing these orders.” (In fact, the rules Trump cited were issued and enforced by the Department of Energy, not the Environmental Protection Agency, where Administrator Zeldin presides.)</p>

<p>None of the standards Trump listed were subject to an executive order, or any other kind of rapid rollback. In simple terms, Trump did not have the legal authority to change these rules.</p>

<p>No matter. Energy Secretary Chris Wright — who had listed “affordability and consumer choice in home appliances” among his <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/secretary-wright-acts-unleash-golden-era-american-energy-dominance">top nine priorities</a> — took up the cause. Three days after Trump’s Truth Social post, Wright <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/energy-department-acts-lower-prices-and-increase-consumer-choice-household-appliances">announced</a> that the Department of Energy was postponing “seven of the Biden-Harris administration’s restrictive mandates on home appliances,” which “have driven up costs, reduced choice and diminished the quality of Americans’ home appliances.” Wright’s list of seven affected “home appliances” actually included three types of commercial equipment and three other regulations long past the point where they could be undone.</p>

<p>That left only one household-product regulation that could be challenged. It involved an item that seemed like an improbable symbol of “freedom” and “consumer choice”: the tankless, gas-fueled hot water heater.</p>

<p>The vast majority of U.S. homes have traditional water heaters with 40- to 50-gallon tanks. By contrast, tankless gas products represent 10% of sales. They are about the size of a carry-on suitcase and heat a stream of water on demand. They’re energy-efficient and roughly twice as expensive as standard heaters.</p>

<p>But the rules governing tankless gas water heaters were vulnerable because they were issued in the final weeks of Biden’s term. That meant lawmakers could reverse them under the Congressional Review Act, which allows lawmakers to block a recently enacted agency rule, if a resolution to do so passes both houses and is signed by the president.</p>

<p>Appearing at <a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/us-secretary-energy-chris-wright-delivers-remarks-cpac">the Conservative Political Action Conference</a> on Feb. 20, Wright drew cheers as he offered a Trumpian litany — “My dishwasher has to run for two hours now, and at the end I got to clean the dishes” — before turning to hot water heaters. “We have a factory in the southeastern part of the United States that employs hundreds of people to build a particularly popular product these days,” Wright said. “It is a tankless water heater powered by natural gas,” which he described as “selling like hotcakes.” So, what did the Biden administration do, he asked. “They passed a regulation that would make that product illegal, and that company would be dead.” But under Trump, declared Wright, waving his arms, “we are fixing that problem. That factory is staying open. … America is back, baby!”</p>

<p>Wright returned to “the hot-water thing” in <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/media/us-department-energy-bringing-common-sense-back-nixes-dei-requirements">a FoxBusiness interview</a> a month later. Assailing “nanny-state, crazy, top-down mandates that makes it more expensive for American consumers and businesses to buy what they want,” he said the new rule was going to shut down a factory “just built in the southeast United States.” Wright acknowledged that U.S. law bars elimination of other efficiency updates that he and Trump have targeted because they’ve already been finalized. “We can’t officially get rid of them,” he commented. “So we just pushed back the enforcement date, hopefully, to never.”</p>

<p>Wright’s portrayal omitted significant details. The administration’s actions involve a single beneficiary: Rinnai, a Japanese appliance company with $3.3 billion in revenues last year. In 2022, Rinnai opened a $70 million factory south of Atlanta, where about 250 U.S. workers build “non-condensing” tankless gas water heaters, a major moneymaker for the company.</p>

<p>“Non-condensing” tankless heaters are less efficient and less expensive than “condensing” tankless heaters, which reuse heat from their exhaust gases. As a result, Rinnai wouldn’t be able to continue selling them when the new standards went into effect in December 2029.</p>

<p>That, however, wasn’t going to put the company out of business; it wasn’t likely to shut down its U.S. factory, either, though Rinnai raised that specter in government filings where its U.S. president warned the new standards would make the Georgia plant “<a href="https://freebeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/EERE-2017-BT-STD-0019-0612_attachment_1.pdf">largely obsolete</a> … eliminating” all its jobs.</p>

<p>Rinnai sells a broad array of products across the world. It also already sold condensing tankless heaters in the U.S. that met the new standard and were imported from Japan. And Rinnai had plans to make them in Georgia, according to the company’s <a href="https://www.rinnai.co.jp/en/corp/csr/pdf/report2024.pdf">most recent annual report</a>. (Rinnai agreed to make its U.S. chief, Frank Windsor, available for an interview with ProPublica, then canceled twice at the last minute. The company ultimately declined to respond to questions about its public representations.)</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the company, now backed by the Trump administration, has pursued a multitrack campaign to roll back the new standards. Its efforts appear to be on the point of success. A resolution has passed the House and won Senate approval on Thursday. Rinnai has spent $375,000 on Washington lobbyists since 2023, according to disclosure reports. The company also joined with Republican attorneys general in a court challenge to the energy rule.</p>

<p>Three major Rinnai competitors supported the Biden-era regulations. Wisconsin-based A.O. Smith has actively lobbied against Rinnai’s effort to win a congressional rollback. Greene said blocking the standard will “disadvantage” U.S. companies, which have already invested in more efficient condensing technology, by allowing continued sale of Rinnai’s less expensive competing products. “In this time of ‘America First,’ it just seems to us a shame that where we’re heading is rewarding foreign manufacturers,” Greene said. “There should be a level playing field.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the administration’s campaign has expanded to multiple fronts. On Wednesday, the Department of Energy announced a review of its procedures for energy standards, which one expert described as a reprise of the first Trump administration’s attempts to create procedural hurdles to updating efficiency standards.</p>

<p>Then there was the executive order on showerheads that same day. It, too, seeks to revive a move by the first Trump administration: to circumvent the limits on waterflow by redefining “showerheads” to include multiple nozzles, each of which could emit as much water as the entire showerhead was previously allowed. The Biden-era Energy Department killed that regulation, and Trump is attempting to bring it back while proclaiming that “notice and comment is unnecessary because I am ordering the repeal.”</p>

<p>That order will have virtually no effect because manufacturers have little interest in making showerheads that exceed the current limits, according to Andrew deLaski, executive director of the Appliance Standards Awareness Project, a nonprofit coalition of groups that support the efficiency rules. “The president is asserting king-like authority,” he added, about Trump’s claim that he does not have to follow administrative procedures.</p>

<p>In the end, DOGE could have more of an impact than a would-be monarch, if it’s able to kill the Guidehouse contract. Then, deLaski said, “it would be next to impossible for DOE to enforce its efficiency standards.”</p>

<p>In the past six months, two babies in Louisiana have died of pertussis, the disease commonly known as whooping cough.</p>

<p>Washington state recently announced its first confirmed death from pertussis in more than a decade.</p>

<p>Idaho and South Dakota each reported a death this year, and Oregon last year reported two as well as its highest number of cases since 1950.</p>

<p>While much of the country is focused on the spiraling measles outbreak concentrated in the small, dusty towns of West Texas, cases of pertussis have skyrocketed by more than 1,500% nationwide since hitting a recent low in 2021 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Deaths tied to the disease are also up, hitting 10 last year, compared with about two to four in previous years. Cases are on track to exceed that total this year.</p>

<p>Doctors, researchers and public health experts warn that the measles outbreak, which has grown to more than 600 cases, may just be the beginning. They say outbreaks of preventable diseases could get much worse with falling vaccination rates and the Trump administration slashing spending on the country’s public health infrastructure.</p>

<p>National rates for four major vaccines, which had held relatively steady in the years before the COVID-19 pandemic, have fallen significantly since, according to a ProPublica analysis of the most recent federal kindergarten vaccination data. Not only have vaccination rates for measles, mumps and rubella fallen, but federal data shows that so have those for pertussis, diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B and polio.</p>

<p>In addition, public health experts say that growing pockets of unvaccinated populations across the country place babies and young children in danger should there be a resurgence of these diseases.</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p>Many medical authorities view measles, which is especially contagious, as the canary in the coal mine, but pertussis cases may also be a warning, albeit one that has attracted far less attention. </p>

<p>“This is not just measles,” said Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious diseases doctor in New York City and author of the book “Booster Shots: The Urgent Lessons of Measles and the Uncertain Future of Children’s Health.” “It’s a bright-red warning light.”</p>

<p>At least 36 states have witnessed a drop in rates for at least one key vaccine from the 2013-14 to the 2023-24 school years. And half of states have seen an across-the-board decline in all four vaccination rates. Wisconsin, Utah and Alaska have experienced some of the most precipitous drops during that time, with declines of more than 10 percentage points in some cases.</p>

<p>“There is a direct correlation between vaccination rates and vaccine-preventable disease outbreak rates,” said a spokesperson for the Utah Department of Health and Human Services. “Decreases in vaccination rates will likely lead to more outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases in Utah.”</p>
        
            
    
    
    
                            

    
            Measles Vaccination Rates in Most States Were Below Herd Immunity in 2023
        

                        
                    
                

            Data is for school year 2013-14 through 2023-24. The CDC recommends a vaccination rate of at least 95% to achieve herd immunity, to help prevent outbreaks and to protect communities. Montana is not categorized as "below herd immunity in 2023" because the state did not report data for school year 2023-24.

            Note: Decrease means that the rate in school year 2013-14 was higher than the rate in school year 2023-24. If no data was reported for 2013-14, data from the next earliest year was used. Montana is not categorized as a state where the vaccination rate decreased because the state did not report data for school year 2023-24.

<p>But statewide figures alone don’t provide a full picture. Tucked inside each state are counties and communities with far lower vaccination rates that drive outbreaks.</p>

<p>For example, the whooping cough vaccination rate for kindergartners in Washington state in 2023-24 was 90.2%, slightly below the U.S. rate of 92.3%, federal data shows. But the statewide rate for children 19 to 35 months last year was 65.4%, according to state data. In four counties, that rate was in the 30% range. In one county, it was below 12%.</p>

<p>“My concern is that there is going to be a large outbreak of not just measles, but other vaccine-preventable diseases as well, that’s going to end up causing a lot of harm, and possibly deaths in children and young adults,” said Dr. Anna Durbin, a professor in the Department of International Health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who has spent her career studying vaccines. “And it’s completely preventable.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p>The dramatic cuts to public health funding and staffing could heighten the risk. And the elevation of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a longtime vaccine critic, to the secretary of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, several experts said, has only compounded matters.</p>

<p>The Trump administration has eliminated 20,000 jobs at agencies within HHS, which includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the nation’s public health agency. And late last month, the administration also cut $11 billion from state and local public health agencies on the front lines of protecting Americans from outbreaks; the administration said the money was no longer necessary after the end of the pandemic.</p>

<p>Several city and county public health officials had to move quickly to lay off nurses, epidemiologists and disease inspectors. Some ceased vaccination clinics, halted wastewater surveillance programs and even terminated a contract with the courier service that transports specimens to state labs to test for infectious diseases. One Minnesota public health agency, which had provided 1,400 shots for children at clinics last year, immediately stopped those clinics when the directive arrived, court records show.</p>

<p>A federal judge temporarily barred HHS from enacting the cuts, but the ruling, which came more than a week after the grants were terminated, was too late for programs that had already been canceled and employees who had already been laid off. Lawyers for HHS have asked the judge to reconsider her decision in light of a recent Supreme Court ruling that allowed the Department of Education to terminate grants for teacher training while that case is being argued in lower courts. The judge in the HHS case has not yet ruled on the motion.</p>

<p>But in tiny storefronts and cozy homes, at school fairs and gas stations, many residents in West Texas, near where the measles outbreak has taken hold, appear unfazed.</p>

<p>“I don’t need a vaccine,” one man sitting on his porch said recently. “I don’t get sick.”</p>

<p>“It’s measles. It’s been around forever,” said a woman making her way to her car. “I don’t think it’s a big deal.”</p>

<p>When asked why they weren’t planning on vaccinating their baby, a husband walking alongside his wife who was 27 weeks pregnant simply said, “It’s God’s will.”</p>

<p>In word and deed, Kennedy has sown doubt about immunizations.</p>

<p>In response to the measles outbreak, Kennedy initially said in a column he wrote for Fox News that the decision to vaccinate is a “personal one.” HHS sent doses of vitamin A alongside vaccines to Texas, and Kennedy praised the use of cod liver oil. Only the vaccine prevents measles.</p>

<p>About a week later, in an interview on Fox News, while Kennedy encouraged vaccines, he said he was a “freedom of choice person.” At the same time, he emphasized the risks of the vaccine.</p>

<p>Only after the second measles death in Texas did <a href="https://x.com/SecKennedy/status/1908967854394982414">Kennedy post</a> on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the “most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.”</p>

<p>But even that is not the unequivocal message that the head of HHS should be sending, said Ratner, the infectious diseases doctor in New York. It is, he said, a tepid recommendation at best.</p>

<p>“It gives the impression that these things are equivalent, that you can choose one or the other, and that is disingenuous,” he said. “We don’t have a treatment for measles. We have vitamin A, which we can give to kids with measles, that decreases but doesn’t eliminate the risk of severe outcomes. It doesn’t do anything for prevention of measles.”</p>

<p>In the past, Kennedy has been a fierce critic of the vaccine. In a foreword to a 2021 book on measles released by the nonprofit that he founded, Kennedy wrote, “Measles outbreaks have been fabricated to create fear that in turn forces government officials to ‘do something.’ They then inflict unnecessary and risky vaccines on millions of children for the sole purpose of fattening industry profits.”</p>

<p>A spokesperson for HHS said, “Secretary Kennedy is not anti-vaccine — he is pro-safety, pro-transparency and pro-accountability.” Kennedy, the spokesperson said, responded to the measles outbreak with “clear guidance that vaccines are the most effective way to prevent measles” and under his leadership, the CDC updated its pediatric patient management protocol for measles to include physician-administered vitamin A.</p>

<p>Kennedy, the spokesperson added, “is uniquely qualified to lead HHS at this pivotal moment.”</p>

<p>Late last month, leaders at the CDC <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/measles-vaccine-rfk-cdc-report">ordered staff to bury a risk assessment</a> that emphasized the need for vaccines in response to the measles outbreak — in spite of the fact the CDC has long <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/partners/vaccinate-with-confidence.html">promoted vaccinations</a> as a cornerstone of public health. While a CDC spokesperson acknowledged that vaccines offer the best protection from measles, she also repeated a line Kennedy had used: “The decision to vaccinate is a personal one.”</p>

<p>Among the approximately 2,400 jobs eliminated at the CDC was a team in the Immunization Services Division that partnered with <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccine-equity/php/about/partnering-for-vaccine-equity-partners.html">organizations</a> to promote access to and confidence in vaccines in communities where coverage lagged.</p>

<p>The National Institutes of Health, which is also under HHS, recently ended funding for studies that examine vaccine hesitancy. In early April, researchers, the American Public Health Association and one of the largest unions in the country sued the NIH and its director, Jay Bhattacharya, along with HHS and Kennedy, alleging they terminated grants “without scientifically-valid explanation or cause.” The government hasn’t filed a response in the case.</p>

<p>The NIH cancellation notices stated that the agency’s policy was not to prioritize research that focuses on “gaining scientific knowledge on why individuals are hesitant to be vaccinated and/or explore ways to improve vaccine interest and commitment.”</p>

<p>“These grants are being canceled in the midst of an outbreak, a vaccine-preventable outbreak,” said Rupali Limaye, an associate professor at George Mason University who has spent the past decade studying vaccine hesitancy. “We need to better understand why people are not accepting vaccines now more than ever. This outbreak is still spreading.”</p>

<p>That vaccines prevent diseases is settled science. For decades, there was a societal understanding that getting vaccinated benefited not only the person who got the shot, but also the broader community, especially babies or people with weakened immune systems, like those in chemotherapy.</p>

<p>An investment in public health and a sustained, large-scale approach to vaccines is what helped the country declare the elimination of the measles in 2000, said Lori Tremmel Freeman, the CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials.</p>

<p>But she has watched both deteriorate over the last few months. Nearly every morning since notices of the federal funding cuts began going out to local public health agencies, she has woken up to texts from panicked public health workers. She has led daily calls with local health departments and sat in on multiple emergency board meetings.</p>

<p>Freeman has compiled a list of more than 100 direct consequences of the cuts, including one rural health department in the Midwest that can no longer carry out immunization services. That’s vital because there are no hospitals in the county and all public health duties fall to the health department.</p>

<p>“It’s relentless,” she said. “It feels like a barrage and assault on public health.”</p>


</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            Vaccines were available at the health department in Lubbock, Texas, last month.
    
    
    
    

    

        
    
                    
<p>More than 1,600 miles away from Washington, D.C., in Lubbock, Texas, the director of the city’s health department, Katherine Wells, sighed last week when she saw the most recent measles numbers. She would have to alert her staff to work late again.</p>

<p>“There’s a lot of cases,” she said, “and we continue to see more and more cases.”</p>

<p>She didn’t know it at the time, but that night would mark the state’s second measles death this year. An earlier death in February was the country’s first in a decade. Both children were not vaccinated.</p>

<p>Kennedy said he traveled to Gaines County to comfort the family who lost their 8-year-old daughter and while there met with the family of the 6-year-old girl who died in February.</p>

<p>He also visited with two local doctors he described as “extraordinary healers,” he said in his post on X. The men, he claimed, have “treated and healed some 300 measles-stricken Mennonite children” using aerosolized budesonide — typically used to prevent symptoms of asthma — and clarithromycin — an antibiotic. Medical experts said neither is an effective measles treatment.</p>

<p>State health officials have traced about two-thirds of the measles cases in Texas to Gaines County, which sits on the western edge of the state.</p>

<p>Seminole, one of the county’s only two incorporated towns, has emerged as the epicenter of the outbreak, with Tina Siemens acting as a community ambassador of sorts.</p>

<p>Siemens, a tall woman with glasses and a short blonde bob, runs a museum that combines the area’s Native American history and Mennonite community with traditional skills like calligraphy and canning fruit.</p>

<p>On a recent Tuesday, atop the museum’s dark coffee table, notes scrawled onto white paper listed the latest shipments of vitamin C and Alaskan cod liver oil.</p>

<p>The supplies, Siemens said, were for one of the local doctors who met with Kennedy.</p>

<p>As measles tears through the community, Siemens said families have to decide whether to get vaccinated.</p>

<p>“In America, we have a choice,” she said, echoing Kennedy’s messaging. “The cod liver oil that was flown in, the vitamin C that was flown in, was a great help.”</p>

<p>Dr. Philip Huang, director and health authority for the Dallas County Health and Human Services Department, is working to keep the measles outbreak from reaching his community, just five hours east of Seminole. He wrote letters to the public school superintendents and leaders of private schools that had large numbers of unvaccinated or undervaccinated students offering to set up mobile vaccine clinics for them.</p>

<p>“Overall, the rates can look OK,” he said, “but when you’ve got these pockets of unvaccinated, that’s where the vulnerability lies.”</p>

<p>Huang has had to lay off 11 full-time employees, 10 temporary workers and cancel more than 50 vaccine clinics following the HHS cuts. The systemic dismantling of the CDC and other federal health agencies, he said, will have a grave and lasting impact.</p>

<p>“This is setting us back decades,” Huang said. “Everyone should be extremely concerned about what’s going on.”</p>


<p>Across the country, pediatricians are petrified, said Dr. Susan Kressly, who serves as president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, the largest professional organization of pediatricians in the country.</p>

<p>“Many of us are losing sleep,” Kressly said. “If we lose that progress, children will pay the price.”</p>

<p>She’s carefully watching the spread of several vaccine-preventable diseases, including an increase in whooping cases that far outpace the typical peaks seen every few years. Although the whooping cough vaccine isn’t as effective as the ones for measles and protection wanes over time, the CDC says it remains the best way to prevent the disease.</p>

<p>Babies under the age of 1 are among the most at risk of severe complications from whooping cough, including slowed or stopped breathing and pneumonia, according to the CDC. About one-third of infants who get whooping cough end up in the hospital. Newborns are especially vulnerable because the CDC doesn’t recommend the first shot until two months. That’s why experts recommend pregnant mothers and anyone who will be around the baby to get vaccinated.</p>

<p>The number of whooping cough cases dropped significantly during the pandemic, but it exploded in recent years. In 2021, the CDC reported 2,116 cases; last year, there were 35,435.</p>

<p>The numbers this year appear set to eclipse 2024. So far in 2025, 7,111 cases have been reported, which is more than double this time last year. Cases tend to spike in the summer and fall, which adds to experts’ concern about high numbers so early in the year.</p>

<p>States on the Pacific Coast and in the Midwest have reported the most cases this year, with Washington leading the country with 742 cases so far, more than five times as many as at this time last year.</p>

<p>The Washington child who died of whooping cough had no underlying medical conditions, according to a spokesperson for the Spokane Regional Health District. The death was announced in February but occurred in November.</p>

<p>While Washington’s overall vaccination rate for whooping cough has remained relatively steady over the last decade at around 90%, pockets of low vaccination rates have allowed the disease to take root and put the wider community at risk, said Dr. Tao Sheng Kwan-Gett, a pediatrician and chief health officer of the Washington State Department of Health.</p>

<p>This is the time to strengthen the public health system, he said, to build trust in those areas and make it easier for children to get their routine vaccines.</p>

<p>“But instead, we’re seeing the exact opposite happen,” he said. “We’re weakening our public health system, and that will put us on a path towards more illness and shorter lives.”</p>

<p>Washington was one of 23 states and the District of Columbia that sued HHS and Kennedy following the $11 billion cuts, which rescinded approximately $118 million from the state. Doing so, the state said in court records, would impact 150 full-time employees and cause an immediate reduction in the agency’s ability to respond to outbreaks.</p>

<p>Washington’s Care-A-Van, a mobile health clinic that travels across the state to provide vaccinations, conduct blood pressure screenings and distribute opioid overdose kits, was a key element in the department’s vaccination efforts.</p>

<p>But that, too, has been diminished.</p>

<p>An alert on the department’s website cataloged the impact.</p>

<p>“Attention,” it began.</p>

<p>As a result of the unexpected decision to terminate grant funding, “all Care-A-Van operations have been paused indefinitely, including the cancellation of more than 104 upcoming clinics across the state.”</p>

<p>The department had anticipated providing approximately 2,000 childhood vaccines as part of that effort.</p>

<p>The frustration came through in Kwan-Gett’s voice. Many people think that federal cuts to public health mean shrinking the federal workforce, he said, but those clawbacks also get passed down to states and cities and counties. The less federal support that trickles down to the local level, the less protected communities will be.</p>

<p>“It really breaks my heart,” he said, “when I see children suffering from preventable diseases like whooping cough and measles when we have the tools to prevent them.”</p>

Title    : From Lollapalooza to Detention Camps: Meet the Tent Company Making a Fortune Off Trump’s Deportation Plans

                        <p><strong>Update, April 11, 2025:</strong> After this story was prepared for publication, Immigration and Customs Enforcement posted on a federal procurement website that it had awarded a new contract worth up to $3.8 billion to Deployed Resources to operate a migrant detention camp on Fort Bliss. It is the largest contract the company has received and the first time ICE is moving ahead with plans to detain thousands of people arrested in the U.S. on military bases in tents before they are deported.</p>

        

    
      
  



                    
<p>In June 2005, a former employee from the Federal Emergency Management Agency toured the grounds of the Bonnaroo music festival in rural Tennessee. He wasn’t there to see the headliners, which included Dave Matthews Band and the lead singer of the popular jam band Phish. He was there to meet the guys setting up the toilets for the throng of psychedelics-infused campers in attendance: Richard Stapleton, a construction industry veteran, and his business partner Robert Napior, a onetime convicted pot grower, who specialized in setting up music festivals.</p>

<p>The meeting, described in court documents, offered the pair’s fledgling company, Deployed Resources, a key introduction to players doing government contract work for the Department of Homeland Security, the agency that oversees not only the nation’s disaster responses but also its immigration system. Over the next two decades, Stapleton and Napior hired more than a dozen former agency insiders as they turned their small-time logistics business, which had helped support outdoor festivals like Lollapalooza, into a contracting giant by building camps for a completely different use: detaining immigrants arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>

<p>Now, as the government races to carry out President Donald Trump’s campaign promise of mass deportations, Deployed is shifting its business once more — from holding people who are trying to enter the country to detaining those the government is seeking to ship out.</p>

<p>In Trump’s second term in office, the government is poised to spend tens of billions of dollars on immigration detention, including unprecedented plans to hold immigrants arrested in the U.S. in massive tent camps on military bases. One recently published request for contract proposals said the Department of Homeland Security could spend up to $45 billion over the next several years on immigrant detention. The plans have set off a gold rush among contractors. All this spending is unfolding at the same time the government has made sweeping cuts to federal agencies and shed other contracts.</p>

<p>Among those seeking a windfall is Deployed Resources, which, along with its sister company, Deployed Services, has adapted to shifting government policies and priorities in immigration enforcement.</p>

<p>Starting in 2016, to help respond to spikes in immigrant crossings that had periodically overwhelmed border stations, Deployed began setting up tent encampments to ease the overcrowding. These temporary structures served as short-term emergency waystations, which several former officials said provided flexibility that the U.S. needed. Many of those arriving — including families and unaccompanied children — were turning themselves in, hoping to be released into the U.S. to apply for asylum. In all, the company has been awarded more than $4 billion in government contracts building and operating border tents, according to an analysis of contracting data by ProPublica.</p>

<p>Since taking office in January, Trump has cracked down on asylum, pushing border crossings to record lows. Last month, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection said it no longer needed the tent facilities run by Deployed.</p>

<p>Instead, ProPublica found, the military will now be contracting with Deployed to use one of those border facilities to house people arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>

<p>In March, one of the company’s tent complexes in El Paso, Texas, was handed over to ICE, CBP and ICE spokespeople said. In an unusual move, the Trump administration tapped funds from the Department of Defense to pay Deployed for the facility, citing the president’s <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/29/2025-01948/declaring-a-national-emergency-at-the-southern-border-of-the-united-states">declaration of an emergency at the southern border</a>, a DOD spokesperson said. The nearly <a href="https://www.defense.gov/News/Contracts/Contract/Article/4140129/">$140 million contract</a> wasn’t posted publicly and was given to Deployed as the “incumbent contractor,” the spokesperson said, without further explaining why ICE would use military funds. ICE said it started transferring detainees to the site — which currently has the capacity to house 1,000 adults — on March 10.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>As immigration raids escalate, detention space in the country’s existing network of permanent ICE prisons is filling up. There are currently around 48,000 immigrants locked up across the country, levels not seen since 2019. Deportations are happening at a slower pace than ICE arrests, according to data shared with ProPublica, so the administration is turning to companies that can quickly set up facilities.</p>

<p>As it looks to expand its capacity, the agency “is exploring all options to meet its current and future detention requirements,” said ICE spokesman Miguel Alvarez.</p>

<p>Yet using tents to house thousands of people arrested by ICE is fundamentally different from using them to house recent border crossers, many of whom weren’t supposed to be held for more than a few days, seven current and former DHS officials who served in both Republican and Democratic administrations told ProPublica.</p>

<p>They said it would be the first time these tent camps would be used for ICE detainees in the U.S. and that it was unclear how they could be constructed to meet the agency’s basic health and safety requirements. These include separate areas for men and women and dedicated zones for families, as well as space to segregate those who are potentially violent, and private meeting areas for lawyers and their clients. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not directly involved in the contracts.</p>

<p>“People that you’ve ripped out of the community, people you’ve arrested, people who want to get back to their children, people who are scared, are going to behave differently than the border crossing population,” said one former ICE official. “You have a lot more fear in the population.”</p>

<p>“It would take a remarkable degree of innovation from a contractor,” said another former DHS official, adding, “It would also be incredibly expensive.”</p>

<p>At a border security conference this week, ICE Acting Assistant Director for Operations Support Ralph Ferguson said that Deployed Resources was modifying the CBP tents in El Paso by adding more rigid structures inside, which he said would make them more secure. Deployed got an additional contract for up to $5 million to provide unarmed guards at the El Paso facility, according to a public notice posted in late March.</p>

<p>The company did not respond to requests for comment. On its website, Deployed says it is “dedicated to safely and efficiently providing transparent facility support and logistical services, anytime, anywhere” and describes itself as “the first-choice provider” for government contracts.</p>

<p>Deployed was also one of the companies interested in operating an immigrant detention camp on the nearby Fort Bliss military base, according to government documents obtained by ProPublica and interviews with people familiar with the contracting process. ICE was seeking proposals from vendors last month for a 1,000-bed camp that could grow to 5,000 beds, housing women and men, including those deemed high security risks, as well as families with small children. The contractor would be responsible for separating those groups and preventing escapes, documents reviewed by ProPublica show.</p>

<p>The plans are “a recipe for disaster,” said Eunice Hyunhye Cho, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Prison Project.</p>

<p>“All of the problems that we see with ICE detention writ large, like the abuse of force, the sexual assault, medical neglect, the lack of food, lack of access to counsel, lack of due process rights, lack of access to telephones — the list goes on — all of those things are going to be vastly more complicated in a system where you are literally setting up people in tents that are surrounded by barbed wire and armed military personnel,” Cho said.</p>

Connections and Contracts
<p>Since 2016, Deployed Resources has enjoyed a virtual monopoly on providing CBP with immigration tent structures to help with sudden influxes of immigrants. During the first Trump administration, the contractor set up temporary tent courts for people forced to wait in Mexico for their asylum hearings under a policy known as the Migrant Protection Protocols. The company also earned hundreds of millions of dollars during the Biden years operating emergency detention facilities for unaccompanied minors that were funded by the Department of Health and Human Services<strong>.</strong></p>

<p>Though the value of Deployed Resources isn’t publicly known, county real estate records attest to the wealth its owners, Stapleton and Napior, have amassed in the detention business.</p>

<p>In the spring of 2019, shortly after the company landed what was then its biggest immigration contract — a $92 million no-bid award to run two tent facilities in Texas — Stapleton purchased a $5.7 million condo in Naples, Florida. Nearly three years and more than $1 billion in contracts later, he upgraded to a $15 million home a block away from the shore. Napior snapped up a $9 million beachside property near Sarasota, Florida, in 2023. Stapleton did not respond to requests for comment. Reached by phone, Napior said he did not comment to the press and then hung up.</p>

<p>After the meeting at Bonnaroo in 2005, Deployed later hired the former FEMA employee who had checked out its facilities there and to win emergency management contracting work at the agency before moving into immigration detention. In court filings, Deployed said that the meeting did not lead to its FEMA work.</p>

<p>Deployed went on to hire additional former DHS officials over the years, expanding its connections to the federal agencies with which it does business. With a second Trump administration poised to crack down further on the flow of immigrants to the southern border — a potential threat to Deployed’s core business — the company hired several former ICE leaders, according to online searches and current and former officials.</p>

<p>A month after Trump’s victory, former ICE field office director Sean Ervin announced he was joining Deployed as a senior adviser for strategic initiatives. He had previously overseen removal operations across Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. The head of field operations for ICE Miami, Michael Meade — an 18-year agency veteran — also joined Deployed that month, according to their profiles on LinkedIn. Meade and Ervin did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Deployed has continued to win federal business even after the spending on the company’s contracts was criticized by government watchdogs and a whistleblower.</p>

<p>A review by Congress’ <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-20-321r">Government Accountability Office</a> of one no-bid CBP contract that the first Trump administration awarded to Deployed found that the company’s 2,500-person facility in Tornillo, Texas, averaged just 30 detainees a night in the fall of 2019 and never held more than 68 during the five-month period it was open. It also found that CBP paid Deployed millions for meals it didn’t need to feed people it wasn’t holding. Deployed agreed to reimburse $250,000 for meals not delivered, the GAO said.</p>

<p>A separate whistleblower lawsuit in New Hampshire brought by a former DHS official who worked for Deployed accuses the company of cutting corners on training its staff to detect and report sexual abuse of children in facilities it set up to house unaccompanied minors during the Biden administration. In court filings, Deployed said it “vigorously disputes the allegations” and has moved to dismiss the suit.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            Construction crews work on an immigrant holding facility in Tornillo, Texas, in 2019. Deployed Resources was contracted to build and provide support services for the 2,500-person detention center, but it closed in 2020 after months of low occupancy.

<p>Last year, Dan Bishop, a former Republican congressman from North Carolina, held up a Deployed Services contract in <a href="https://www.qcnews.com/news/u-s/north-carolina/no-children-at-greensboro-immigrant-facility-because-capacity-isnt-needed-yet-mayor-says/">Greensboro</a>, North Carolina, as an example of waste during a hearing on <a href="https://homeland.house.gov/2024/11/19/this-is-a-moral-outrage-chairmen-higgins-bishop-deliver-opening-statements-in-hearing-on-unaccompanied-alien-children-under-biden-harris/">unaccompanied migrant children</a>. The company was paid nearly $40 million to help operate a facility for immigrant children, Bishop said, but it stood empty for over two years.</p>

<p>Deployed nonetheless had workers there full time, according to interviews with three former employees familiar with the facility, tasking them with playacting as if they were providing care. Case managers invented case details and Deployed workers would role-play as students in classrooms, even asking for permission to go to the bathroom, according to the former Deployed workers and social media posts of former workers describing the surreal situation.</p>

<p>“I have no idea why they were doing that with government money,” said one former case manager, who recalled inventing elaborate backstories for fictional children, filling out make-believe statements and other paperwork for hours each day. The case manager spent about a year in Greensboro, living in housing paid for by Deployed from its government contract. Deployed did not respond to requests for comment about its Greensboro contract.</p>

<p>Now, with even more money to be spent on immigration detention, Deployed is just one of the companies hoping to benefit. In addition to Fort Bliss more than 10 military sites around the country are being considered for ICE detention facilities, according to a DHS document shared with ProPublica. The New York Times previously reported on elements of the plan.</p>

<p>The Fort Bliss contracting process has proceeded mostly out of public view, and it’s not clear if the project would go forward or fall under the larger $45 billion plan to expand immigration detention. In March, representatives from at least 10 companies, including Deployed Resources, toured Fort Bliss with DHS officials to survey the site, said two people familiar with the visit. Also there were private prison giants The GEO Group and CoreCivic, the sources said.</p>

<p>The GEO Group’s leadership and allied political action groups donated more than $1 million to Trump’s reelection effort, according to a <a href="https://www.pogo.org/investigations/private-prison-giant-hired-ice-detention-chief">review by the Project on Government Oversight</a>, a nonpartisan Washington watchdog group. On its most recent <a href="https://www.investing.com/news/transcripts/earnings-call-transcript-geo-group-q4-2024-misses-eps-forecast-stock-rises-93CH-3897328">earnings call</a>, GEO’s CEO said Trump’s immigration agenda was an “unprecedented opportunity” for the firm. CoreCivic — which <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/private-prison-firm-corecivic-gave-500k-trumps-inauguration/story?id=118218707">donated $500,000 to Trump’s inauguration committee</a> — has also <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4757210-corecivic-inc-cxw-q4-2024-earnings-call-transcript">spoken about the business opportunities</a>. After Trump’s election, stock prices for both companies jumped.</p>

<p>CoreCivic said it is in “regular contact” with government agencies “to understand their changing needs” but said that it does not comment on contracts it is seeking. Its contribution to inauguration events was “consistent with our past practice of civic participation” supporting both parties. The GEO Group did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Deployed Services has largely eschewed political donations, sticking to its strategy — also used by GEO and CoreCivic — of hiring former high-ranking government officials.</p>

<p>A few weeks ago Deployed scored another high-profile ICE hire: Marlen Pineiro joined Deployed after 40 years in government, including more than a decade in ICE’s Senior Executive Service, according to her LinkedIn profile. At a border security conference this week, where several former high-ranking DHS employees hired by Deployed were gathered among industry vets and Trump immigration officials, Pineiro declined an interview request from a ProPublica reporter.</p>

<p>But on LinkedIn, the congratulations rolled in. The acting head of ICE under Trump, Todd Lyons, posted: “Great news.” Two other senior ICE officials who had also recently joined Deployed commented: “Welcome aboard.”</p>

<p>“Let’s sail away,” Pineiro replied. “Woohooo see you soon.”</p>

<p><em>Note: ProPublica analyzed transaction-level contract data from usaspending.gov for this story. Contract amounts reported are federal obligations over the life of a contract or group of contracts.

<p>Prompted by ProPublica’s reporting on efforts by right-wing activists to disallow ballots, North Carolina Democrats have introduced a bill designed to prevent votes from being tossed out based on postelection rule changes.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://webservices.ncleg.gov/ViewBillDocument/2025/3521/0/DRH10319-LUe-63D">Voter Protection and Reliance Act</a>, filed last week in the North Carolina House, says that ballots cast in state elections will be counted based on the laws and procedures in place on Election Day. It also forbids votes from being discarded because of technical or clerical errors in voter registrations.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/jefferson-griffin-north-carolina-supreme-court-challenge-election-integrity-network">ProPublica reported</a> that before the 2024 election, North Carolina activists and members of the Election Integrity Network — a national group led by a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/06/953823383/attorney-on-call-with-trump-and-georgia-officials-resigns-from-law-firm">lawyer integral</a> to President Donald Trump’s unsuccessful campaign to overturn the 2020 election — discussed whether filing protests aimed at voters whose registration information was incomplete could help candidates overturn losses in close elections.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>The strategy debated on that call, which ProPublica obtained a recording of, subsequently was used by Republican Court of Appeals Judge Jefferson Griffin to challenge his 734-vote loss to Democrat Allison Riggs for a seat on the state’s Supreme Court.</p>

<p>“ProPublica’s reporting showed people were hunting for pretexts to challenge the election ahead of time,” said Phil Rubin, a Democratic House member who was the primary author of the bill. “Rather than trying to proactively fix those problems before the election, Judge Griffin has retroactively tried to exploit them to overturn his loss. This law would prevent similar abuses in the future and force candidates to act for the good of the voters and not themselves.”</p>

<p>A spokesperson for Griffin, Paul Shumaker, said he couldn’t respond to Rubin’s comments, his bill or questions from ProPublica because North Carolina’s Code of Judicial Conduct prohibits judges and judicial candidates from stating a position on issues that could come before the court.</p>

<p>“It would be a violation to comment on legislation since legislation is subject to judicial review if enacted into law,” Shumaker said.</p>

<p>Last week, the Republican-majority North Carolina Court of Appeals <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/north-carolina-supreme-court-election-certification-blocked">ruled that</a> election officials should discount around 60,000 ballots in the Supreme Court race cast by voters whose Social Security and driver’s license information is missing in the state election database unless the voters provided that information within 15 working days. (That ruling has <a href="https://www.carolinajournal.com/state-supreme-court-presses-pause-on-griffin-riggs-election-dispute/">subsequently been stayed</a> while the state’s Supreme Court considers the matter.)</p>

<p>At the time of the election, state election rules allowed people to vote without that information and allowed members of the military to submit absentee ballots without providing photo ID. Often, the election database was missing Social Security and driver’s license information not because of voters’ errors, but because of administrative mistakes, including a registration form that did not require these forms of identification.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the <a href="https://appellate.nccourts.org/opinions/?c=2&amp;pdf=44509">appeals court ruled</a> that the state election board — the body that issues election rules — should have required the information.</p>

<p>Griffin’s ballot challenges have been shown by data analyses to disproportionately affect <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/rd6j71wh7csby6fqextyz/griffin-uocava-jan-20-2025.pdf?rlkey=rk2fkcloxb2aiw6r32o1h3bf9&amp;e=1&amp;dl=0">Democrats</a> and <a href="https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/election/article296693744.html">minorities</a>, making it possible that their exclusion may upend the election results.</p>

<p>Rubin’s bill also mandates that litigation involving election-related issues must be dealt with on an expedited basis by North Carolina courts so that candidates can resolve issues before elections rather than afterward.</p>

<p>Though some <a href="https://www.longleafpol.com/p/how-i-see-the-jefferson-griffin-case">North Carolina</a> and <a href="https://www.carolinajournal.com/opinion/echoes-of-gores-florida-recount-in-griffins-attempt-to-toss-ballots/">national Republicans</a> have criticized Griffin’s challenges, the Democratic-sponsored bill faces uncertain prospects in the GOP-controlled legislature.</p>

<p>“The bill is going nowhere,” said Mitch Kokai, a senior political analyst for the conservative John Locke Foundation. “It’s more of a statement of the Democratic caucus’ approach to the Griffin-Riggs election and how they think it should have played out.”</p>

<p>North Carolina’s governor and its legislative leadership did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Rubin said that while the bill reflects issues playing out in North Carolina, it also could serve as a model for other states.</p>

<p>“There is no reason to think that these tactics will be limited to North Carolina,” he said at a press conference on Thursday hosted by the Democratic National Committee and North Carolina Democratic Party about the Supreme Court case litigation, at which he presented the bill.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://whoscounting.us/ein-booklet-pdf/">Election Integrity Network</a> has chapters in swing states, plus many others, and partners with numerous national conservative organizations.</p>

<p>The leader of the North Carolina chapter did not respond to a request for comment or emailed questions.</p>

Title    : Trump’s EPA Plans to Stop Collecting Greenhouse Gas Emissions Data From Most Polluters

<p>The Environmental Protection Agency is planning to eliminate long-standing requirements for polluters to collect and report their emissions of the heat-trapping gases that cause climate change. The move, ordered by a Trump appointee, would affect thousands of industrial facilities across the country, including oil refineries, power plants and coal mines as well as those that make petrochemicals, cement, glass, iron and steel, according to documents reviewed by ProPublica.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/learn-about-greenhouse-gas-reporting-program-ghgrp">Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program</a> <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/data-sets">documents</a> the amount of carbon dioxide, methane and other climate-warming gases emitted by individual facilities. The data, which is publicly available, guides policy decisions and constitutes a significant portion of the information the government submits to the international body that tallies global greenhouse gas pollution. Losing the data will make it harder to know how much climate-warming gas an economic sector or factory is emitting and to track those emissions over time. This granularity allows for accountability, experts say; the government can’t curb the country’s emissions without knowing where they are coming from.</p>

<p>“This would reduce the detail and accuracy of U.S. reporting of greenhouse gas emissions, when most countries are trying to improve their reporting,” said Michael Gillenwater, executive director of the Greenhouse Gas Management Institute. “This would also make it harder for climate policy to happen down the road.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p>The program has been collecting emissions data since at least 2010. Roughly 8,000 facilities a year now report their emissions to the program. EPA officials have asked program staff to draft a rule that will drastically reduce data collection. Under the new rule, its reporting requirements would only apply to about 2,300 facilities in <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgreporting/subpart-w-information-sheet">certain sectors of the oil and gas industry</a>.</p>

<p>Climate experts expressed shock and dismay about the apparent decision to stop collecting most information on our country’s greenhouse gas emissions. “It would be a bit like unplugging the equipment that monitors the vital signs of a patient that is critically ill,” said Edward Maibach, a professor at George Mason University. “How in the world can we possibly manage this incredible threat to America’s well-being and humanity’s well-being if we’re not actually monitoring what we’re doing to exacerbate the problem?”</p>

<p>The EPA did not address questions from ProPublica about the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. Instead, the agency provided an emailed statement affirming the Trump administration’s commitment to “clean air, land, and water for EVERY American.”</p>

<p>The agency announced last month that it was <a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/trump-epa-announces-reconsideration-burdensome-greenhouse-gas-reporting-program">“reconsidering” the greenhouse gas reporting program</a>. In a little-noticed press release issued on March 12, when the EPA sent out 24 bulletins as it celebrated the “<a href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-launches-biggest-deregulatory-action-us-history">most consequential day of deregulation in U.S. history</a>,” EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin described the reporting program as “burdensome.” Zeldin also claimed that the program “costs American businesses and manufacturing millions of dollars, hurting small businesses and the ability to achieve the American Dream.”</p>

<p>Project 2025, the far-right blueprint for Trump’s presidency, suggested severely scaling back the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program and also described it as imposing burdens on small businesses.</p>

<p>In contrast, climate experts say the EPA reporting program, which tallies between 85% and 90% of all greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., is in many ways a boon to businesses. “A lot of companies rely on the data and use it in their annual sustainability reports,” said Edwin LaMair, an attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund. Companies also use the data to demonstrate environmental progress to shareholders and to meet international reporting requirements. “If the program stops, all that valuable data will stop being generated,” LaMair said.</p>

<p>The loss of that data could have a devastating effect on the world’s ability to rein in the disastrous effects of the warming climate, according to Andrew Light, who served as assistant secretary of energy for international affairs in the Biden administration. Light noted that addressing the dangerous and costly extreme weather events requires international collaboration — and that our failure to collect data could give other countries an excuse to abandon their own reporting.</p>

<p>“We will not get to the kinds of temperature stabilization needed to protect Americans against the worst climate impacts unless we get the cooperation of developing countries,” Light said. “If the United States won’t even measure and report our own emissions, how in the world can we expect China, India, Indonesia and other major growing developing countries to do the same?”</p>

<p>In its first months, the Trump administration has shown waning support for the reporting program. The EPA left the portal through which companies share data closed for several weeks and, in March, pushed back the emissions reporting deadline. Then last Friday, a meeting held with several program staff members raised further questions about the fate of future data collection, according to sources who were briefed on the meeting and asked not to be named for fear of retribution.</p>

<p>At the meeting, political appointee Abigale Tardif, who is principal deputy assistant administrator of the EPA’s office of air and radiation, instructed staff to draft a rule that would eliminate reporting requirements for 40 of the 41 sectors that are now required to submit data to the program. Tardif did not respond to inquiries from ProPublica about this story. Political appointee Aaron Szabo, who was present at the meeting and is awaiting confirmation as assistant administrator to the office, declined to answer questions, directing a reporter to EPA communications staff.</p>

<p>Before joining the EPA, Tardif and Szabo worked as lobbyists. Szabo represented the American Chemistry Council and Duke Energy <a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/federal-lobbying/lobbyists/summary?cycle=2023&amp;id=Y0000055386L">among other companies and trade groups</a> and Tardif worked for Marathon Petroleum and the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers Association.</p>

<p>Some climate advocates noted that industry stands to benefit from the elimination of greenhouse gas reporting requirements. “T​he bottom line is this is a giveaway to emitters, just letting them off the hook entirely,” said Rachel Cleetus, senior policy director with the Climate and Energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists.</p>

<p>Cleetus derided the choice to stop documenting emissions as ostrich-like. “Not tracking the data doesn’t make the climate crisis any less real,” she said. “This is just putting our heads in the sand.”</p>

Title    : An Algorithm Deemed This Nearly Blind 70-Year-Old Prisoner a “Moderate Risk.” Now He’s No Longer Eligible for Parole.

<p>Calvin Alexander thought he had done everything the Louisiana parole board asked of him to earn an early release from prison.</p>

<p>He had taken anger management classes, learned a trade and enrolled in drug treatment. And as his September hearing before the board approached, his disciplinary record was clean.</p>

<p>Alexander, more than midway through a 20-year prison sentence on drug charges, was making preparations for what he hoped would be his new life. His daughter, with whom he had only recently become acquainted, had even made up a room for him in her New Orleans home.</p>

<p>Then, two months before the hearing date, prison officials sent Alexander a letter informing him he was no longer eligible for parole. </p>

<p>A computerized scoring system adopted by the state Department of Public Safety and Corrections had deemed the nearly blind 70-year-old, who uses a wheelchair, a moderate risk of reoffending, should he be released. And under <a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1353171">a new law</a>, that meant he and thousands of other prisoners with moderate or high risk ratings cannot plead their cases before the board. According to the department of corrections, about 13,000 people — nearly half the state’s prison population — have such risk ratings, although not all of them are eligible for parole.</p>

<p>Alexander said he felt “betrayed” upon learning his hearing had been canceled. “People in jail have … lost hope in being able to do anything to reduce their time,” he said.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            Calvin Alexander’s daughter, Sabrina Brown, left, and his sister, Jerry Hart. Alexander was planning for his new life with Brown when he found out he was no longer eligible for parole.

<p>The law that changed Alexander’s prospects is part of a series of legislation passed by Louisiana Republicans last year reflecting Gov. Jeff Landry’s <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/louisiana-jimmie-duncan-bite-mark-analysis-death-row-junk-science">tough-on-crime agenda</a> to make it more difficult for prisoners to be released. </p>

<p>While campaigning for governor, Landry, a former police officer and sheriff’s deputy who served as Louisiana attorney general until 2024, championed a crackdown on rewarding well-behaved prisoners with parole. Landry said early release, which until now has been typically assumed when judges hand down sentences, is a slap in the face to crime victims. </p>

<p>“The revolving door is insulting,” Landry <a href="https://gov.louisiana.gov/index.cfm/newsroom/detail/4425">told state lawmakers last year</a> as he kicked off a special legislative session on crime during which he blamed the state’s high violent crime rate on lenient sentences and “misguided post-conviction programs” that fail to rehabilitate prisoners. (In fact, Louisiana’s recidivism rate has declined over the past decade, according to a 2024 department of corrections report.)</p>
        
    
                    
<p>The Legislature <a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1353036">eliminated parole for nearly everyone</a> imprisoned for crimes committed after Aug. 1, making Louisiana the <a href="https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2024/08/21/louisiana_parole_reform/#:~:text=With%20the%20passage%20of%20HB,releasing%20people%20from%20its%20prisons.">17th state in a half-century to abolish parole altogether</a> and the first in 24 years to do so. For the vast majority of prisoners who were already behind bars, like Alexander, <a href="https://legis.la.gov/legis/ViewDocument.aspx?d=1353171">another law</a> put an algorithm in charge of determining whether they have a shot at early release; only prisoners rated low risk qualify for parole. </p>

<p>That decision makes Louisiana the only state to use risk scores to automatically rule out large portions of a prison population from being considered for parole, according to seven national criminal justice experts.</p>

Developed as a rehabilitative measure about a decade ago, it was supposed to help prison officials determine what types of classes or counseling someone might need to prevent them from landing back behind bars — not be used as a punitive tool to keep them there, said one of its creators.</p>

<p>Criminal justice advocates and civil rights attorneys say the new law could <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing">disproportionately harm Black people</a> like Alexander in part because the algorithm measures factors such as criminal history where racial disparities already exist. The law’s opponents also contend that the unique step Louisiana has taken to curtail parole is deeply problematic — and potentially unconstitutional — because it does not take into account the efforts of prisoners to better themselves while incarcerated.   </p>

<p>“They deserve that opportunity to show they’ve changed,” said Pearl Wise, who was appointed to the parole board by Landry’s Democratic predecessor and served from 2016 until 2023. “You demonstrate over time the changes that you made and that you are not the person that was sentenced on that day.” </p>

An Immutable Risk Score
<p>Alexander is like thousands of prisoners who have previously appeared before the board — repeat offenders accused of nonviolent crimes, often mired in addiction with limited education or learning disabilities. Alexander can’t read or write, having dropped out of school as a fourth grader in the early 1960s. He needed to help support his family in deeply segregated Mississippi and turned to selling crack cocaine as a child. That period was also the start of his own lifelong struggle with narcotics that resulted in multiple arrests and extended stints in prison. </p>

<p>The department of corrections would not allow an in-person or phone interview with Alexander. Instead, Verite News and ProPublica mailed Alexander written questions, which a fellow inmate read to him and then wrote down his responses. Alexander admitted he was reckless in his youth and that he had violated his parole — related to a 1994 drug possession conviction — by drinking and staying out after curfew. That mistake would prove devastating three decades later because a prisoner’s history of parole violations plays a significant role in their TIGER risk score.</p>

<p>Louisiana’s TIGER scoring system was born out of a 2014 federal initiative to help states reduce their prison populations. The risk assessment tool, developed by the state department of corrections and Louisiana State University researchers using a $1.75 million federal grant, was meant to “treat criminal thinking,” said Keith Nordyke, one of the creators of TIGER. For populations with the highest risk of reoffending, he said, the prison would flood them with services — addiction counseling, therapy, job training — to help keep them out of trouble once they were freed. </p>

<p>“The whole purpose of this was to slow down the revolving door,” Nordyke said. </p>

<p>Louisiana corrections officials started using the TIGER scores as part of the parole determination process in 2018, but it was only in 2024 that they became the sole  measure of parole eligibility. </p>

<p>Similar algorithms are <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing">used throughout the country</a> in the parole decision-making process, but legal scholars say the way such risk tools calculate a person’s odds of reoffending is among the reasons why no other state exclusively uses them to bar individuals from parole. While algorithms like TIGER can predict on a group level that 40 out of 100 people will reoffend upon their release, they can’t pinpoint exactly who those 40 people will be, according to experts. </p>

<p>The Louisiana department of corrections declined multiple interview requests and did not respond to questions about the state’s use of the risk tool.</p>

<p>The reliance on a TIGER score to potentially block a prisoner’s bid for freedom is especially concerning, experts on risk assessment tools say, because most of the factors considered by the algorithm — the crimes they committed, work history, age at first arrest, whether they had any marijuana-related convictions, prior parole revocations — are from a prisoner’s past, which cannot be changed; they do not include anything related to what people have done in prison to rehabilitate themselves. </p>

<p>Criminal justice scholars say that when scores based on immutable facts are weighted so heavily in parole decisions, prisoners from impoverished, racially segregated communities are more likely to be hurt.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            A fellow inmate wrote down Alexander’s answers to Verite and ProPublica’s questions on what he misses and what he would have done had he been granted parole.

<p>Take the algorithm’s use of prior employment data: People raised in low-income communities <a href="https://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2020/beyond-bls/employment-barriers-within-low-and-moderate-income-communities.htm">do not have the same work opportunities</a> as those brought up in more affluent neighborhoods, said Megan Stevenson, an economist and criminal justice professor at the University of Virginia School of Law. Using such an algorithm to determine someone’s chances of parole, she said, “suggests that poor people should be less eligible for parole than wealthier people.” </p>

<p>Factoring in prior drug convictions, too, is more likely to impact Black prisoners, Stevenson said. Black people use illegal drugs at roughly the same rate as white people, but are arrested and convicted for it in greater numbers because their neighborhoods are more heavily policed, she said.</p>

<p>In using these data points to produce a risk score, “you’re going to create a biased algorithm to make biased decisions,” Stevenson said.  </p>

<p>Already, Black people account for nearly two-thirds of Louisiana’s prison population, more than double their share of the state population. </p>

<p>The Landry administration did not respond to requests for comment regarding potential racial biases in the way the TIGER scores are used for parole. </p>

<p>Louisiana’s legislation might also violate the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits laws that retroactively increase the severity of a person’s criminal sentence, according to several legal scholars. Tying parole eligibility to a computerized risk score that can’t be lowered by an inmate through good behavior or other actions appears to do just that since the opportunity for parole has traditionally been considered part of a sentence, said Sonja Starr, a professor at the University of Chicago Law School.</p>

<p>Some former Louisiana parole board members also bristled at the idea of an algorithm superseding human judgment. </p>

<p>“It doesn’t make much sense to me that a score generated by a process that the inmate has no control over takes away the authority and the power of the parole board,” said Keith Jones, who was appointed by Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards and served on the board from 2018 to 2020. “Why have a parole board?”</p>

<p>Jones and two other former parole board members said the introduction of the TIGER tool as part of parole determination wasn’t in itself a bad thing, as long as it remained just one factor to be considered among many. </p>

<p>Although some board members did refuse to parole anyone with a moderate or high risk score before the law took effect, the state’s parole board had much more discretion in determining when a prisoner was released, former board members said<em>.</em></p>

<p>Tony Marabella, a former East Baton Rouge criminal court judge who served on the parole board until last year, said he had placed greater emphasis on a prisoner’s disciplinary record and completion of self-improvement programs. He also took into account whether the warden or victims supported their release when deciding whether to grant parole. </p>

<p>“If someone was a moderate risk, I wasn’t going to throw them out,” said Marabella, who served on the board for four years under Edwards. “I was more concerned about what they had accomplished.”</p>

<p>That’s exactly what Alonzo Allen was able to show.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            Alonzo Allen, outside of his home in Mansfield, Louisiana, was paroled nearly four years ago. He had a moderate risk assessment score, which, after the passage of a 2024 law, would now prohibit him from appearing before the board.

<p>In 2021, three years before the new law went into effect, Allen succeeded in convincing the parole board that he was worthy of release — despite having the same TIGER score and a similar criminal history as Alexander.</p>

<p>Allen had been sentenced to 40 years behind bars in 2012 on multiple drug charges and carrying a gun. While in prison, he was written up for possessing contraband, including a pencil sharpener and $2 worth of sugar, and he previously had his parole revoked twice, according to Allen and the parole board.</p>

<p>As a result, he was marked a moderate risk.</p>

<p>During Allen’s parole hearing, Jerry Goodwin, then warden at the David Wade Correctional Center in Homer, where Allen was being held, lauded Allen for his tireless work overcoming his drug addictions and improving his communication skills. Goodwin noted that Allen took classes even when he knew he had reached his limit for “good time” credits, time shaved off a sentence for good behavior.</p>

<p>“He’s worked hard for this opportunity,” Goodwin told the parole board, “and I think he’s really got his best foot forward.”</p>

<p>Alvin Roche’ Jr., then a member of the parole board, questioned the accuracy of Allen’s TIGER score. “Is it possible that this instrument might be wrong?” Roche’ asked during Allen’s hearing. “You think you are rehabilitated to the point where you can prove that assessment wrong?”  </p>

<p>“Yes, sir, very much, sir,” Allen responded. “I do think that is wrong.”  </p>

<p>The board unanimously voted to parole Allen.  </p>

<p>Speaking by telephone from his home in Mansfield, just south of Shreveport, Allen, 61, said he was grateful for the second chance. He’s stayed sober, works full time as a truck driver and has not violated the terms of his parole in the nearly four years since his release. </p>

<p>“God has been good,” he said.</p>

Steeply Declining Parole Hearings
<p>Lawmakers who supported Louisiana’s push to place strict limits on parole have maintained that relying on the algorithm over human judgment was the most efficient way to clear a backlog of parole applications. </p>

<p>State Sen. Patrick McMath, R-Covington, the bill’s author, claimed during a Senate committee hearing in February 2024 that so many unrealistic parole petitions were coming before the board that prisoners most deserving of early release were not being prioritized.</p>

<p>“What I’m really trying to do here is make the system run more efficiently and effectively,” McMath said.</p>

<p>But data from the parole board doesn’t support his assertion. According to the parole board’s annual reports, the number of cases heard by the board actually dropped by 40% between 2016 and 2023. </p>

<p>Prison reform advocates and civil rights attorneys say McMath’s bill was never anything more than a Trojan horse designed to kill parole, given the law’s other requirements that make parole substantially harder to achieve, including a unanimous board vote before parole is granted and an increase in the number of years prisoners must maintain clean disciplinary records. </p>

<p>McMath declined to be interviewed and did not answer questions concerning the impact of his legislation.</p>

<p>Landry, who signed the legislation into law in March 2024, appointed <a href="https://lailluminator.com/2024/05/31/new-orleans-lawmaker-grills-landry-parole-board-nominee-about-prisoner-labor/">five new people</a> to the seven-member board. None of the seven were permitted to comment about the use of TIGER to deny prisoners parole, according to Francis M. Abbott, executive director of the Louisiana Board of Pardons and Committee on Parole, citing board policy. Instead, he provided a statement from board chair Sheryl Ranatza: “We believe Governor Landry’s reforms passed in the special crime session will enhance public safety.”</p>

<p>The average number of people paroled in Louisiana has already dropped from 32 per month in 2023 to six per month since the law went into effect in August, according to Department of Corrections data. And at least 70 parole hearings, including Alexander’s, were canceled between Aug. 1 and Dec. 13 because of the prisoner’s risk score, according to the parole board.</p>

<p>Opponents of the bill predict the new restrictions on parole will swell the state’s prison population, costing taxpayers billions of dollars to build new corrections facilities and leading to more violence behind bars as inmates have fewer incentives to behave.     </p>

<p>For Alexander, that means he will not have the same opportunity Allen did to show the parole board that he had heeded their advice to improve himself.</p>

<p>With his health rapidly deteriorating, his family fears he will not live to see the end of his sentence in five years. “He’s got one eye. He’s diabetic. He’s got poor circulation,” said Alexander’s daughter, Sabrina Brown. “I don’t want to have to go to a funeral for him.”</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p>Instead of moving into Brown’s New Orleans home as planned, Alexander will be able to see his daughter only when she makes the 85-mile trek north to the Rayburn Correctional Center. </p>

<p>It wasn’t supposed to be this way, he said.</p>

<p>“They told me once I received my risk score there is nothing I can do to change it,” Alexander said. “It’s like walking into a brick wall.”</p>

Title    : What Reality TV Gets Wrong About Criminal Investigations. (Spoiler: So Much.)
Published: Wed, 09 Apr 2025 10:30:00 -0400
Summary  :
<p class="byline">
                by <a class="name" href="https://www.propublica.org/people/taylor-kate-brown">Taylor Kate Brown</a>                </p>
                                             

        
                        <p>ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. This piece was originally published in Dispatches, a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country. <a href="https://www.propublica.org/newsletters/dispatches">Sign up</a> to receive our stories in your inbox every week.</p>

        

    
      
  



                    
<p>When Edgar Barrientos-Quintana left prison last November, he told reporters: “Happy to be out here. … It’s the best week. And more to come.” It was an understated moment from a man who had been in prison for close to 16 years for a murder that officials said he didn’t commit. And it provided a stark contrast to the reality television show that depicted the investigation that led to his arrest. </p>

<p>Barrientos-Quintana was freed after the Minnesota attorney general’s Conviction Review Unit found he had been wrongfully convicted and recommended vacating his conviction. The unit’s 180-page report cited failures by police, prosecutors and Barrientos-Quintana’s own defense lawyers. But it also mentioned something reporter Jessica Lussenhop had never seen before in a wrongful conviction case: the involvement of popular true crime show “The First 48.” The show begins each episode with the premise that the chance of solving a murder is “cut in half” if police don’t have a significant lead within 48 hours of a killing — which also creates a sense of deadline pressure.</p>

<p>In two stories ProPublica recently published, Lussenhop follows the show’s involvement in the <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/first-48-reality-tv-police-minneapolis-wrongful-conviction-barrientos-quintana">murder investigation that landed Barrientos-Quintana</a> in prison, and how the show’s two-decade history of filming in cities across the U.S. has left <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/first-48-reality-tv-police-dallas-memphis-mobile">a complicated trail</a> of problems and municipal regret.</p>

<p>I talked to Lussenhop about what she learned about how “The First 48” operates and why so many cities have stopped working with the show.</p>
        
    
                        
    
        What did you find surprising while reporting this story?
    
        
    
                    
<p>Finding out that these episodes often air before a defendant’s trial. The show has disclaimers to the effect of “everyone is innocent until proven guilty,” but those words go by in a flash, and as a viewer, I certainly haven’t paid much attention to them. This person is still innocent until proven guilty, but the show does a good job of depicting them as guilty.</p>

<p>What else was surprising was just the sheer number of times there were problems. There are shows like “Live PD” that have had extremely high-profile controversies and have been canceled. But “The First 48” has been on the air for 20 years, and multiple cities ended their relationships with the show. It’s not just the defense bar that’s upset with it. It’s prosecutors, judges, mayors, city council people, all saying, “Why did our police department decide to do this?”</p>
        
    
                        
    
        Why do police departments get involved with this show?
    
        
    
                    
<p>As far as we understand it, police departments don’t make any money off this show, and if you take into account the lawsuits, sometimes the show winds up costing cities money. Then the question becomes, well, why would any police department agree to do this? I think the answer is that police departments are often the subject of negative news coverage. They want a light shone on the work of their homicide detectives and everyone who supports their investigations.</p>

<p>But one of the other important things is these are often the kinds of homicides that are not going to get a lot of press attention. “The First 48” does often interview the victim’s family; they’ll show the victim’s picture on television and say a little bit about their lives. That might be way more media attention than these victims would otherwise get. They’re often poor, they’re often people of color, and the kinds of homicides that may get very little attention in their local media. So I think that it does, in a sense, provide a service.</p>
        
    
                    

    
            Watch: Reality Cop Show “The First 48” and the Wrongly Convicted Man
        

    
                                
            
        

    



        
    
                        
    
        How is this similar to and different from other wrongful conviction cases?
    
        
    
                    
<p>A lot of what’s in Barrientos-Quintana’s Conviction Review Unit report are the hallmarks of wrongful convictions: very young witnesses being interrogated for a very long time, sometimes without parents or lawyers involved; police not following photo lineup procedures; the defense claiming that the prosecution is withholding evidence from them. But to our knowledge, this is the first exoneration ever to be tied to “The First 48.”</p>

<p>Multiple people, including the Hennepin County prosecutor, told me that the very premise of the show is extremely problematic because it makes it sound like you have to rush. The show has a literal clock that’s ticking down in the corner of the screen. Obviously, you want good leads early on, but you have to keep an open mind to evidence that’s going to come into play later on. One of the big pieces of evidence in Barrientos-Quintana’s exoneration is the existence of surveillance tape of him at a grocery store with a girl roughly 33 minutes before the shooting happened. That was not a piece of evidence that they had within the first 48 hours, or even within the first two weeks. </p>

<p>There’s also just the notion that if you have a camera crew following you around, you’re going to behave differently. Especially if it’s a camera crew for a show called “The First 48,” which implies you better make something happen in 48 hours. That could have an effect on your actions as an investigator.</p>
        
    
                        
    
        What did you hear from the family of Jesse Mickelson, the victim Barrientos-Quintana was convicted of killing?
    
        
    
                    
<p>Multiple members of the family have accepted that Barrientos-Quintana is not guilty. Those were some of the most fascinating conversations that I had. If you spent 15 years not only believing that he’s guilty but in a certain sense hating him for destroying your family, and to be presented with new evidence and then be like, “Wait a minute, I think we got this wrong” — that just takes a lot of courage and heart. </p>

<p>I spoke to Mickelson’s half-sister, Tina Rosebear. She thought of the show as sort of a document of this awful experience that her family had gone through, but it was something that acknowledged her brother’s life. She found it almost a source of comfort to watch the episode. But now she has very, very different feelings, and she draws a bright line connecting the television show to the fact that their family may never know who shot and killed Mickelson. Maybe these investigators didn’t do as good a job as they could have because they were rushing to meet this 48-hour thing. For a variety of reasons, the opportunity to catch whoever did this has passed, and she can’t help wondering if that’s in some way the show’s fault.</p>

<p><em>The companies that produce the show did not respond to numerous requests for comment or to a detailed list of questions. The detectives involved in the case also declined to comment. One prosecutor in the original case against Barrientos-Quintana is now a judge and thus precluded from speaking to the press by the Minnesota Code of Judicial Conduct; another took issue with many of the characterizations in the Conviction Review Unit report but agreed that “The First 48” had been a problem.</em></p>

Title    : “They Don’t Care About Civil Rights”: Trump’s Shuttering of DHS Oversight Arm Freezes 600 Cases, Imperils Human Rights

<p>On Feb. 10, more than a dozen Department of Homeland Security officials joined a video conference to discuss an obscure, sparsely funded program overseen by its Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties. The office, charged with investigating when the national security agency is accused of violating the rights of both immigrants and U.S. citizens, had found itself in the crosshairs of Elon Musk’s secretive Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.</p>

<p>It began as a typical briefing, with Homeland Security officials explaining to DOGE a program many describe as a win-win. It had provided some $20 million in recent years to local organizations that provide case workers to keep people in immigration proceedings showing up to court, staff explained, without expensive detentions and ankle monitors.</p>

<p>DOGE leader <a href="https://projects.propublica.org/elon-musk-doge-tracker/#Kyle-Schutt">Kyle Schutt</a>, a technology executive who developed a GOP online fundraising platform, interrupted. He wanted Joseph Mazzara, DHS’s acting <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/person/joseph-n-mazzara">general counsel</a>, to weigh in. Mazzara was recently appointed to the post after working for Ken Paxton as both an assistant solicitor general and member of the Texas attorney general’s defense team that beat back public corruption charges.</p>

<p>Schutt had a different interpretation of the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/dhs-cmpp">program</a>, according to people who attended or were briefed on the meeting.</p>

<p>“This whole program sounds like money laundering,” he said.</p>

<p>Mazzara went further. His facial expressions, his use of profanity and the way he combed his fingers through his hair made clear he was annoyed.</p>

<p>“We should look into civil RICO charges,” Mazzara said.</p>

<p>DHS staff was stunned. The program had been mandated by Congress, yet Homeland Security’s top lawyer was saying it could be investigated under a law reserved for organized crime syndicates.</p>

<p>“I took it as a threat,” one attendee said. “It was traumatizing.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p>For many in the office, known internally as CRCL, that moment was a dark forecast of the future. Several said they scrambled to try to fend off the mass firings they were seeing across the rest of President Donald Trump’s administration. They policed language that Trump’s appointees might not like. They hesitated to open complaints on hot-button cases. They reframed their work as less about protecting civil rights and more about keeping the department out of legal trouble.</p>

<p>None of it worked. On March 21, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem shut down the office and fired most of the 150-person staff. As a result, about 600 civil rights abuse investigations were frozen.</p>

<p>“All the oversight in DHS was eliminated today,” one worker texted after the announcement that they’d been fired.</p>

<p>Eight former CRCL officials spoke with ProPublica about the dismantling of the office on the condition of anonymity because they feared retribution. Their accounts come at a time when the new administration’s move to weaken oversight of federal agencies has faced legal challenges in the federal courts. In defending its move to shut CRCL, the administration said it was streamlining operations, as it has done elsewhere. “DHS remains committed to civil rights protections but must streamline oversight to remove roadblocks to enforcement,” said DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin.</p>

<p>CRCL staff “often functioned as internal adversaries to slow down operations,” McLaughlin added. She did not address questions from ProPublica about the February meeting. Mazzara and Schutt did not reply to requests for comment.</p>

<p>The office’s closure strips Homeland Security of a key internal check and balance, analysts and former staff say, as the Trump administration morphs the agency into a mass-deportation machine. The civil rights team served as a deterrent to border patrol and immigration agents who didn’t want the hassle and paperwork of an investigation, staff said, and its closure signals that rights violations, including those against U.S. citizens, could go unchecked.</p>

<p>The office processed more than 3,000 complaints in fiscal year 2023 — on everything from disabled detainees being unable to access medical care to abuses of power at Immigration and Customs Enforcement and reports of rape at its detention centers. For instance, following reports that ICE had performed facial recognition searches on millions of Maryland drivers, a CRCL investigation led the agency to agree to new oversight; case details have been removed from the <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/publication/crcl-recommendation-memo-ice-regarding-ice-use-maryland-database-and-facial-recognition">DHS website</a> but are available in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250207021847/https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2023-05/ice-response-facial-recognition-04-24-23.pdf">internet archive</a>. The office also reported to Congress that it had investigated and confirmed allegations that a child, a U.S. citizen traveling without her parents between Mexico and California, had been sexually abused by Customs and Border Protection agents during a strip search.</p>

<p>Those cases would have gone nowhere without CRCL, its former staffers said.</p>

<p>“Nobody knows where to go without CRCL, and that’s the point,” a senior official said. Speaking of the administration, the official went on, “They don’t want oversight. They don’t care about civil rights and civil liberties.”</p>

<p>The CRCL staff, most of them lawyers, emphasized that their work is not politically motivated, nor is it limited to immigration issues. For instance, sources said the office was <a href="https://www.wcnc.com/article/weather/hurricane/helene/trump-supporters-fired-fema-worker-avoid-helping-hurricane-victims/275-10ec484e-bdbb-4e22-b18c-6aee8f3aa926">investigating allegations</a> that disaster aid workers with the Federal Emergency Management Agency had <a href="https://ncnewsline.com/2024/11/20/repub/fema-head-testifies-about-reports-trump-supporters-homes-were-passed-over-for-aid/">skipped over houses</a> that displayed signs supporting Trump during the 2024 election.</p>

<p>“The Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties touches on everyone,” one fired employee said. “There’s this perception that we’re only focused on immigrants, and that’s just not true.”</p>

Uncertainty and Panic
<p>The final days of the civil rights office unfolded in a cloud of uncertainty and panic, as with other federal offices getting “RIF’d,” the Beltway verb for the government’s “reduction in force.”</p>

<p>Staff members described the weeks before the shutdown as a whittling away of their work. Dozens of investigative memos posted online in a transparency initiative? Deleted from the site. The eight-person team on racial equity issues? Immediately placed on leave. Travel funds to check conditions at detention centers? Reduced to $1.</p>

<p>As fear intensified that the civil rights office would be dismantled, staff tried to lie low. Leaders told staff to stop launching investigations that came from media reports, previously a common avenue for inquiries. Now, only official complaints from the public would be considered.</p>

<p>Staff was particularly frustrated that under this new mandate it couldn’t open an official investigation into the case of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/columbia-university-mahmoud-khalil-ice-15014bcbb921f21a9f704d5acdcae7a8">Mahmoud Khalil</a>, a Columbia University graduate student and legal resident who was arrested for participating in protests against Israel’s war in Gaza.</p>

<p>With dozens of employees spread across branches or working remotely, many civil rights staffers had never met their colleagues — until the Trump administration’s return-to-office order forced them to come in five days a week. By early March, when reality had sunk in that their jobs were likely to be eliminated, they began quietly organizing, setting up encrypted Signal chat groups and sharing updates on lawsuits filed by government workers in other agencies.</p>

<p>“It’s inspiring how federal employees are pushing back and connecting,” one worker said.</p>

<p>Beyond Trump’s mandate to remove all references to diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, leaders told staff to omit from memos words such as “however,” which might sound combative, or “stakeholders,” which came across as too warm and fuzzy.</p>

<p>“Daily life was one miserable assignment after the next,” a staffer said. The orders coming down from Trump appointees were intended to “basically tell us how to undo your office.”</p>

<p>In what would be the last days of the office, the atmosphere was “chilling” and “intimidating.” Some personnel froze, too afraid to make recommendations, while others risked filing new investigations in final acts of defiance.</p>

<p>When the news came on a Friday that they were all being fired, civil rights staff were told they couldn’t issue any out-of-office reply, one former senior official said.</p>

<p>They are still technically employees, on paid leave until May 23. Many have banded together and are exploring legal remedies to get their jobs back. In the interim, if complaints are coming in, none of the professionals trained to receive them are around.</p>

What’s Been Lost
<p>Days after the meeting in which allegations of money laundering and organized crime were loosely thrown at CRCL employees, <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/dhs-cmpp">the program in question</a> was shut down. That effort had essentially earmarked money to local charities to provide nonviolent immigrants with case workers who connect them to services such as human trafficking screening and information on U.S. law. Created by Congress in 2021, the goal was to keep immigrants showing up to court.</p>

<p>Now, Trump’s DHS is suggesting the case worker program is somehow involved in human smuggling. Erol Kekic, a spokesperson for the charity the federal government hired to administer funds in that program, said Church World Services received a “weirdly worded letter” that baffled the organization’s attorneys.</p>

<p>“They said there could be potential human trafficking,” he said, referring to DHS. “But they didn’t accuse us directly of it.”</p>

<p>The nonprofit is working on its response, he said.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, the absence of Homeland Security’s civil rights oversight is already reverberating.</p>

<p>With their office closed, CRCL staff now fear the hypotheticals: At ports of entry, Americans’ Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches and seizure are relaxed; if CBP abuses its power to root through phones and laptops, who will investigate? And if DHS began arresting U.S. citizens for First Amendment protected speech? Their office would have been the first line of defense.</p>

<p>As an example of cases falling through the cracks, CRCL staff told ProPublica they had recommended an investigation into the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/17/brown-university-rasha-alawieh-deported-lebanon">deportation of a Lebanese professor</a> at Brown University who was in the country on a valid work visa. Federal prosecutors said in court she was detained at an airport in Boston in connection with “sympathetic photos and videos” on her phone of leaders of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/doctor-deported-lebanon-had-photos-sympathetic-hezbollah-phone-us-says-2025-03-17/">Reuters</a> reported she told border authorities she did not support Hezbollah but admired the group’s deceased leader Hassan Nasrallah for religious reasons.</p>

<p>Staff also wanted to look into the case of a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/15/us/parents-deported-mexico-daughter-cancer-treatment/index.html">10-year-old girl recovering from brain cancer</a> who, despite being a U.S. citizen, was deported to Mexico along with her parents when they hit an immigration checkpoint as they rushed to an emergency medical visit.</p>

<p>In Colorado, immigration attorney Laura Lunn routinely filed complaints with CRCL, saying pleas with ICE officials at its Aurora detention center were often ignored. Those complaints to CRCL have stopped her clients from being illegally deported, she said, or gotten emergency gynecological care for a woman who had been raped just before being detained.</p>

<p>But now, she asks, “Who do I even go to when there are illegal things happening?”</p>

<p>Lunn’s group, the Rocky Mountain Immigration Advocacy Network, has also joined in large group complaints about inadequate medical care, COVID-19 isolation policies and access to medical care for a pod of transgender inmates.</p>

<p>She’s among those trying to find clients who were housed in the Aurora facility but have mysteriously disappeared. Her clients had pending proceedings, she said, yet were summarily removed, something she’d never seen in 15 years of immigration law.</p>

<p>“Ordinarily, I would file a CRCL complaint. At this moment, we don’t have anyone to file a complaint to,” Lunn said.</p>

<p>That sort of mass deportation is something CRCL would have inspected. In fact, staff members said they had just launched a review into Trump’s increased use of Guantanamo Bay to detain migrants, an inquiry which now appears to have vanished.</p>

<p>She said she has several pending complaints, including one about a detainee who has stomach cancer but can’t get medication stronger than ibuprofen and another involving an HIV-positive patient who hasn’t been able to see a doctor.</p>

<p>“CRCL was one of the very few tools we had to check ICE, to hold ICE accountable,” Genovese said. “Now you see them speeding to complete authoritarianism.”</p>

Title    : No, President Trump, the Income Tax Wasn’t A Mistake. But It Was an Accident.

<p>In his Rose Garden speech launching a global trade war by announcing the most sweeping tariffs in modern history, President Donald Trump bestowed a history lesson on his audience that diverged from the factual record: </p>

<p>“Then in 1913, for reasons unknown to mankind, they established the income tax so that citizens, rather than foreign countries, would start paying the money necessary to run our government. Then in 1929, it all came to a very abrupt end with the Great Depression, and it would have never happened if they had stayed with the tariff policy; it would have been a much different story.”</p>

<p>So why did we institute an income tax? Were there any humans who knew what the reasoning was? And did the actions of 1913 lead to the Great Depression in 1929?</p>

<p>There is a clear consensus among historians on these points. No, the income tax was not a mistake. </p>

<p>But it was something stranger: both a 40-year struggle and an accident.</p>

<p>In 1913, the states ratified the 16th Amendment, which gave the federal government the power to “collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived.”</p>

<p>This was not the first income tax effort, however.</p>

<p>For a few short years during and after the Civil War, the United States imposed its first tax on income to help fund the massive costs of the war. Placed on relatively high incomes but only collecting a modest percentage, it was cast as both a way to generate needed revenue and a way to maintain fairness.</p>

<p>Yes, that’s right, one of the chief selling points of taxing income was that it was a way of achieving “equity” in the burdens of the war. Responding to allegations that only poor men were fighting and dying, President Abraham Lincoln and his Republican Party made sure the law required that the taxes people paid would be publicly disclosed. Unsurprisingly, the wealthy men of the dawning Gilded Age did not like seeing their tax information in the pages of The New York Times. Wealthy interests forced a repeal of the income tax in 1871, and the federal government returned to funding itself with proceeds from user fees and tariffs.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>Efforts to rein in the rich persisted, however. Congress moved in 1894 to reintroduce an income tax. The populist Nebraskan politician William Jennings Bryan gave a famous speech on the floor of Congress. Responding to the argument that the wealthy would leave America if they had to pay such a tax, then proposed as 2% on the top incomes, he said:</p>

<p>“Of all the mean men I have ever known, I have never known one so mean that I would be willing to say of him that his patriotism was less than 2 per cent deep. … If ‘some of our best people’ prefer to leave the country rather than pay a tax of 2 per cent, God pity the worst.”</p>

<p>Congress passed the law. One year later, however, the Supreme Court controversially rejected it, 5-4, in the case of Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan and Trust Company. The party of Lincoln, now dominated by wealthy Northeastern interests, celebrated. Its <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=o89CDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=cordell+hull+odium+funeral&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=meLFdG46sh&amp;sig=ACfU3U0gw7S-VMDyaBq3GOTKCydhG_fHyA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjB--foxKj5AhXXD1kFHZ_CDaoQ6AF6BAgYEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=cordell%20hull%20odium%20funeral&amp;f=false">1894 platform</a> had declared that an income tax “will bring odium on any party blind enough to support it” and predicted that party’s “funeral.” </p>

<p>Populists like Bryan didn’t give up. A young Democratic congressman from Tennessee named Cordell Hull said in his maiden speech on the floor in 1908, in which he proposed passing another income tax, that he was willing to risk the “odium and the funeral.”</p>

<p>Hull’s effort didn’t gather much momentum that time, but he didn’t give up. He obsessively talked with anyone and everyone about an income tax, so much so that when leaders of his own party saw him approaching, they “would turn and walk in another direction,” he later recalled. </p>

<p>Soon he would succeed, but only thanks to the help of the party that was against the income tax — the Republicans.</p>


<p>In 1909, the country was facing a severe drop in federal revenue and a widening deficit after the financial panic of 1907, which had ended only thanks to a bailout led by J.P. Morgan, the most powerful banker of the age. At the same time, with new responsibilities like trying to keep food and medicines safe and maintaining a growing empire abroad, the federal government’s needs were exploding. A few years earlier, Congress had allocated $1 billion in spending for the first time ever (about $30 billion in today’s dollars).</p>

<p>To address these issues, the Republican party turned to tariffs. Tariffs not only remained the cornerstone of Republican economic policy, they were also the key to the party’s political power. Each time a new tariff bill came up for consideration was like “throwing bananas in a cage of monkeys,” economist Henry George said. Lobbyists from every corner of American industry descended on the capital to push for lower imposts on their companies and, if possible, to have them raised on someone else. </p>

<p>Tariffs and levies on things like tobacco and alcohol were deeply unpopular with the public. They were regressive, costing working people a far greater percentage of their income than the rich. In one of his speeches, Hull attacked the new dominant class of oligarchs: “The world has never seen such colossal fortunes as we behold in the present age ... the Carnegies, the Vanderbilts, the Morgans, and the Rockefellers, with their aggregated billions of hoarded wealth.”</p>

<p>Hull said, “It would seem that this class of people consider themselves almost immune from any kind of taxation.” He closed a speech with a warning to his congressional colleagues: “Public sentiment is becoming aroused.”</p>

<p>In Washington, lawmakers had a bounty of novel ideas for raising funds. Some members of Congress suggested an inheritance tax, others a corporate profits tax, and still others wanted some version of a stamp tax on commercial documents. As president, Theodore Roosevelt supported an income tax, though he didn’t do much to push it legislatively. Most Republican senators, many of whom were millionaires themselves, had mild aversions to some of the proposals and a particular loathing for the income tax.</p>

<p>Nelson Aldrich, the Senate majority leader from Rhode Island, a millionaire and the father-in-law of John D. Rockefeller Jr., was arguably the most powerful politician in the country at the time. Teddy Roosevelt nicknamed him the “King Pin.” In 1909, Aldrich was trying to pass a new tariff bill. Hull’s Democrats posed a problem for him, but not the only one. He also faced a rebellious faction within his own party, the progressive Republicans. These were largely Midwestern and Western leaders who argued for what they described as working people’s interests, as well as reforms to improve public safety and the strengthening of labor unions. They also supported an income tax.</p>

<p>Aldrich tried a series of legislative maneuvers to delay votes on anything about the income tax. The proponents were undeterred, and, as a next step, he and then-President William Taft put their weight behind a corporate income tax, contending that it would be a lesser evil than a personal income tax. The wealthy did not like it, but it passed surprisingly easily, leaving Republicans hopeful the income tax was dead. In a private letter to a friend, the president explained, “A good many people who are attacking [the corporate income tax] now will be glad to use it as a means of preventing the income tax later on.”</p>

<p>Taft proved to be overly optimistic. Supporters of the income tax kept pushing, seeking to raise money directly from the wealthy. A debate ensued about whether Congress could simply pass an income tax law or, since the Supreme Court had struck one down recently, whether a constitutional amendment was needed. Hull pointed out that the makeup of the court had changed and argued that a law could now pass muster with the justices. </p>

<p>Then, one progressive Republican proposed an income tax amendment.</p>

<p>Aldrich pounced on what he perceived as his opponents’ misstep. He <a href="https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/serials/files/cato-journal/1981/5/cj1n1-10.pdf">threw his support to the measure</a> as a means of placating the advocates for a national income tax. In exchange, enough lawmakers agreed to back Aldrich’s tariff bill.</p>

<p>Aldrich, of course, did not support the income tax amendment, but he believed it was too radical to be ratified by three-fourths of the states, the minimum required by the Constitution. Leading politicians assumed that the defeat of the amendment would likely kill the income tax for years, if not a generation.</p>

<p>Hull agreed with that analysis and was despondent. “It has long been understood that the Republicans never support a worthy cause until forced by public sentiment. Too stupid to devise and enact wholesome laws and to formulate and execute sound administrative policies, this piratical organization is wont to wait until Democrats point the way,” he said in a speech on the floor.</p>

<p>And so Nelson Aldrich, the senator who had done more than almost any other American politician in history to protect the wealthy, introduced what would turn out to be an historic measure to amend the Constitution and explicitly allow income taxes on the rich. A few days later, with little fanfare, the amendment passed the Senate by a unanimous vote of 77-0.</p>

<p>Soon after, Congress passed the <a href="https://study.com/academy/lesson/history-of-the-payne-aldrich-tariff-act.html#:~:text=The%20Payne%2DAldrich%20Tariff%20Act%20angered%20progressives%20due%20to%20Taft's,support%20of%20lower%20tariff%20rates.">Payne-Aldrich Tariff bill</a>, giving Aldrich his victory.</p>

<p>But Aldrich had miscalculated and Hull had been too gloomy. After a slow start for the ratification movement, political winds shifted and enough states came around. The amendment was ratified four years later. Then it fell to Hull to almost singlehandedly write what became the 1913 income tax law. </p>

<p>Hull’s plan proved prescient. He had foreseen that if the United States ever became entangled in a war that involved attacks on shipping, imports would dry up and tariff revenue would plummet. When the United States joined the war against Germany in 1917, Congress had to raise income tax rates to generate the money needed to pay for the expense of sending soldiers to Europe.</p>

<p>So no, President Trump, the origins of the income tax are not lost to history.</p>

<p>But did the tax cause the Great Depression 16 years after its enactment, as Trump has argued? No serious economist thinks so. Here’s one data point: In the 1920s, Republicans regained the presidency. Andrew Mellon, one of the richest men in the country, became Treasury secretary. One of the main causes he worked for was lowering income taxes, and the lead-up to the worst economic calamity of the 20th century was actually marked by a decline in those tax rates.</p>

<p>The evidence is similarly clear on Trump’s argument that continued reliance on tariffs to fund the government would have averted the Great Depression. In June of 1930, President Herbert Hoover signed into law the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, significantly raising taxes on imported goods in hopes of boosting American industries and increasing domestic employment. Hoover brushed aside the arguments of his own economists who warned that other nations would respond with their own tariffs, touching off a trade war in which every country would lose.</p>

<p>Economists now agree that Hoover’s tariffs deepened the economic downturn that had begun with the 1929 stockmarket crash. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt gradually reduced the tariffs during his presidency, and his Democratic and Republican successors continued that pattern well into the 21st century.</p>

<p>Today’s situation has similarities to the pre-income-tax years. The American economy is again marked by wealth inequality, with the largest gap between rich and poor we’ve seen since the Gilded Age. We are having debates about how to reduce the federal deficit, about <a href="https://www.vox.com/money/23634085/biden-2024-budget-billionaire-tax-capital-gains">how to fairly and adequately tax the rich</a> and about what the appropriate size of government would be. Last week, Trump reached back in history to restore U.S. tariffs to the Smoot-Hawley levels, triggering a global selloff in stock markets around the world.</p>

Title    : North Carolina Lawmakers Ask for Investigation Into Funding Disruptions for Sexual Abuse Survivors

<p>Members of a bipartisan committee of North Carolina senators are asking the state auditor to investigate how money intended to stop human trafficking had been spent and managed, in response to ProPublica’s reporting.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/north-carolina-legislature-power-grab-sexual-abuse-survivors">ProPublica had reported</a> how the Republican-dominated legislature had directed $15 million for sexual abuse survivors away from Democratic-led agencies that had long overseen such money, sending it to a tiny commission in the Republican-helmed state court system. The Human Trafficking Commission struggled to disburse the funds in a timely manner, according to its former grants administrator. Staffers at 18 crisis centers told ProPublica payments were delayed for months and led to cuts, some of which continue to limit urgent, potentially lifesaving services.</p>

<p>“It sounds like something that we can definitely put the auditor on,” said Sen. Steve Jarvis, a Republican co-chair of the <a href="https://ncleg.gov/Committees/NoticeDocument/8380/Regulatory-Reform-Wed--4225-at-1000-AM">Committee on Regulatory Reform</a>, after a Democratic senator highlighted ProPublica’s reporting in a meeting last week.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>The committee subsequently <a href="https://www.wral.com/story/republican-state-auditor-would-get-more-say-over-nc-government-cuts-in-bill-moving-in-senate/21939286/">advanced a bill</a> to empower the state auditor to create a team to investigate waste, fraud and inefficiency in state spending and report to lawmakers what can be cut. <a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/Sessions/2025/Bills/Senate/PDF/S474v1.pdf">The DAVE Act</a> — named for Republican State Auditor Dave Boliek — would create under him the Division of Accountability, Value and Efficiency. This division has been <a href="https://www.carolinajournal.com/state-level-doge-effort-moves-forward-in-nc-senate/">widely described</a> as North Carolina’s version of the federal Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE.</p>

<p>Boliek told the senators that he was moving quickly to respond to ProPublica’s reporting. Boliek said that he had read the article and put it on his team’s “whiteboard,” and that he had established a “rapid response team” as “a way for us to be proactively reactive” even before the division is officially established. Boliek did not respond to questions about the nature and timing of the investigation sent to his office.</p>

<p>Sen. Woodson Bradley, a Democratic member of the committee, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DH9uM2vp2Ev/?igsh=N3lrbTUxZ2Q0anoz">said in the meeting</a> that as a survivor of domestic violence, “this story broke my heart. It broke my trust.” Bradley said she had heard from numerous survivors across the state about the story.</p>

<p>“So I’m asking publicly, before the DAVE Act goes to the Senate floor, to explain to all of North Carolina what went wrong here? How can we fix this?” Bradley said, leading to the promises from the Republican senator and state auditor to look into the Human Trafficking Commission.</p>

<p>Bradley said that after the meeting, “The auditor gave me personal assurances that he or his team would look into this. Though the existence of such investigations is rarely made public, I followed up to ask for a formal investigation, and I’m waiting for” written confirmation.</p>

<p>In the meeting, Bradley also raised concerns that the DAVE Act could be politicized, with investigations targeting agencies led by Democrats or serving them, as Democrats have accused <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/03/13/house-democrats-doge-elon-musk-donald-trump">DOGE of doing</a>. She argued that the redirection of the $15 million to the Human Trafficking Commission had happened through a partisan maneuver in a past state budget and worried that the DAVE Act could be similarly skewed. “It needs to be an honest and bipartisan review,” Bradley said.</p>

<p>Boliek promised to do his job in “a nonpartisan way that’s data-centric” and based on “what we’re actually getting as a return on investment on taxpayer dollars.”</p>

<p>In addition to the $15 million redirected to the Human Trafficking Commission, lawmakers gave the commission additional money specifically for faith-based groups. The group that received the most money from the commission — $640,000 — had been created by the former head of the state GOP about two months before it was named in the 2021 budget. In October 2024, the group wrote in its quarterly report to the court system that it had assisted only four victims, and its executive director said that at least three of those women had been given only food and gas and no long-term services. The executive director told ProPublica that as of March 2025 the group had helped about two dozen victims.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the court system declined to comment for this article, pointing ProPublica to its <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/north-carolina-legislature-power-grab-sexual-abuse-survivors">past statements</a>.</p>

<p>“Our experience is that support for fighting human trafficking is nonpartisan in the legislature,” the spokesperson had previously told ProPublica, “as it is in the Judicial Branch.”</p>

<p>After the meeting, Jarvis told ProPublica that the DAVE Act was meant to address situations “exactly” like those with the Human Trafficking Commission.</p>

<p>The goal of the DAVE division, Jarvis said, would be to get down into the details of how efficiently agencies are working to make sure they are “operating the right way.”</p>

Title    : Trump Said Cuts Wouldn’t Affect Public Safety. Then He Fired Hundreds of Workers Who Help Fight Wildfires.

<p>President Donald Trump’s executive orders shrinking the federal workforce make a notable exception for public safety staff, including those who fight wildland fires. But ongoing cuts, funding freezes and hiring pauses have weakened the nation’s already strained firefighting force by hitting support staff who play crucial roles in preventing and battling blazes.</p>

<p>Most notably, about 700 Forest Service employees terminated in mid-February’s “Valentine’s Day massacre” are <a href="https://www.nps.gov/subjects/fire/wildland-fire-incident-qualifications.htm">red-card-carrying staffers</a>, an agency spokesperson confirmed to ProPublica. These workers hold other full-time jobs in the agency, but they’ve been trained to aid firefighting crews, such as by providing logistical support during blazes. They also assist with prescribed burns, which reduce flammable vegetation and prevent bigger fires, but the burns can only move forward if there’s a certain number of staff available to contain them. (Non-firefighting employees without a red card cannot perform such tasks.)</p>

<p>Red-card-carrying employees are the “backbone” of the firefighting force, and their loss will have “a significant impact,” said Frank Beum, a board member of the National Association of Forest Service Retirees who spent more than four decades with the agency and ran the Rocky Mountain Region. “There are not enough primary firefighters to do the full job that needs to be done when we have a high fire season.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p>ProPublica spoke to employees across the Forest Service — which manages an area of land nearly twice the size of California — including staff working in firefighting, facilities, timber sales and other roles, to learn how sweeping personnel changes are affecting the agency’s ability to function. The employees said cuts, which have hit the agency’s recreation, wildlife, IT and other divisions, show the Trump administration is shifting the agency’s focus away from environmental stewardship and toward industry and firefighting.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding Trump’s stated guardrails, the cuts have affected the Forest Service’s more than 10,000-person-strong firefighting force. Hiring has slowed as there are fewer employees to get new workers up to speed and people are confused about which job titles can be hired. Other cuts have led to the <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-funding-freeze-wildfire-season">cancellation of some training programs and prescribed burns</a>.</p>

<p>“It’s all really muddled in chaos, which is sort of the point,” one Forest Service employee told ProPublica.</p>

<p>“This agency is no longer serving its mission,” another added.</p>

<p>The employees asked not to be named for fear of retribution.</p>

<p>The Forest Service did not respond to questions about the impact of cuts other than to clarify the number of terminated employees. The Forest Service spokesperson said <a href="https://www.hcn.org/articles/how-doge-threatens-the-forest-service-and-public-lands/">about 2,000 probationary employees</a> — typically new staff and those who were recently promoted, groups that have fewer workplace protections — were fired in February. Others with knowledge of the terminations, including a representative of a federal union and a Senate staffer, said the original number of terminated employees was 3,400 but that decreased, likely as workers were brought back in divisions such as timber sales.</p>

<p>The White House and a representative from the Department of Government Efficiency did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>In early March, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/05/nx-s1-5318687/usda-fired-federal-employees-probationary-osc-mspb">an independent federal board that reviews employees’ complaints</a> compelled the Department of Agriculture, the Forest Service’s parent department, to reinstate more than 5,700 terminated probationary employees for 45 days. During their first weeks back on the payroll, many, including Forest Service personnel, were put on paid administrative leave and given no work.</p>

<p>The administration and DOGE continue working toward layoffs amid court challenges to their moves. Word circulated throughout the Forest Service in March that departmental leadership had compiled lists <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2025/03/06/forest-service-braces-for-up-to-7-000-layoffs-00215563">containing the names of thousands of additional Forest Service employees who could be soon laid off</a>, according to some workers.</p>

<p>Additionally, understaffing in the agency’s information technology unit is threatening firefighting operations, according to an agency employee. In December, the branch chief overseeing IT for the agency’s fire and aviation division left the job. The Department of Agriculture posted the job opening, describing the division as providing “support to the interagency wildland fire community’s technical needs.” This includes overseeing software that firefighting crews use to request equipment — everything from fire-resistant clothing to hoses — from the agency’s warehouses so first responders have uninterrupted access to lifesaving equipment.</p>

<p>The day after Trump’s inauguration, the Department of Agriculture removed the IT job posting. The position remains unfilled, according to an employee with knowledge of the situation.</p>

<p>The hiring of new firefighters has also bogged down amid the deluge of sometimes-conflicting orders from the administration and DOGE, Forest Service staffers said.</p>

<p>“We are really, really behind onboarding our employees right now,” a Forest Service firefighter told ProPublica.</p>

<p>The staffing issues <a href="https://www.hcn.org/articles/the-forest-service-is-cutting-its-seasonal-workforce-and-public-lands-will-suffer/">exacerbate challenges that predate the second Trump administration</a>. To address a massive budget shortfall, the Forest Service under President Joe Biden last year paused the hiring of seasonal workers, except those working on wildfires. (Firefighters did see a permanent pay increase codified by <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/federal-firefighters-secure-permanent-pay-raises-spending-bill-rcna196109">Congress in its recently approved spending bill</a>.)</p>

<p>Still, many permanent employees, including many firefighters, work on a seasonal basis and are placed on an unpaid status for several months each year when there is less work. Uncertainty within the federal government has led many of these employees to give up on government work and look elsewhere.</p>

<p>“Some of our people have taken other jobs,” one Forest Service employee told ProPublica. “People aren’t going to wait around.”</p>

<p>Cuts to the agency’s legal department will also curb its ability to care for the nation’s forests and fight wildfires, an employee told ProPublica. Large prescribed burns and other vegetation-removal projects require environmental review, a process that is often targeted with lawsuits, including by green groups concerned that the efforts go too far in removing trees.</p>

<p>A smaller legal staff could lead to fewer prescribed burns, increasing the risk of catastrophic fires, according to a lawyer for the Department of Agriculture who worked on Forest Service projects. The lawyer was fired in the mid-February purge of probationary employees.</p>

<p>“Every time we lose a case out West, it means the Forest Service can’t do a project, at least temporarily,” the lawyer said.</p>

<p>“They’re going to get sued more, and they’re going to lose more,” said the lawyer, who was reinstated in March <a href="https://www.usda.gov/about-usda/news/press-releases/2025/03/11/usda-status-update-probationary-employees">following the board ruling that the Department of Agriculture’s mass firings were illegal</a>.</p>

<p>The employee received back pay but was immediately put on administrative leave. Because of the cuts to support staff, it was several weeks before many of the returning employees were reissued government laptops and badges and allowed to do any work.</p>

<p>“Government efficiency at its finest,” the lawyer said.</p>

Title    : Connecticut DMV Never Set Up System to Enforce a Century-Old Towing Law
Published: Mon, 07 Apr 2025 05:00:00 -0400
Summary  :
<p class="byline">
                by <a class="name" href="https://ctmirror.org/author/daltimari/">Dave Altimari</a> and <a class="name" href="https://ctmirror.org/author/gmonk/">Ginny Monk</a>, <a href="https://ctmirror.org/">The Connecticut Mirror</a>                </p>
                                             

        
                        <p>This article was produced for ProPublica’s Local Reporting Network in partnership with <a href="https://ctmirror.org/">The Connecticut Mirror</a>. <a href="https://www.propublica.org/newsletters/dispatches">Sign up for Dispatches</a> to get stories like this one as soon as they are published.</p>

        

    
      
  



                    
<p>This year, the head of Connecticut’s Department of Motor Vehicles made a startling public admission, telling lawmakers that the agency, which regulates the towing industry, has never enforced a century-old law meant to protect drivers whose cars are towed.</p>

<p>Under that law, if vehicle owners don’t reclaim their towed cars or can’t afford the fees, towing companies can sell them, but they are required to hold onto the proceeds for a year so the vehicle owner can claim the money. Tow companies are entitled to subtract their fees. But, even if the owner still doesn’t come forward, the companies aren’t supposed to pocket the profits and must turn over any remaining money to the state.</p>

<p>DMV Commissioner Tony Guerrera told lawmakers the agency had never set up a process to accept deposits and wasn’t tracking whether any money had come in.</p>

<p>In fact, the DMV commissioner said he wasn’t aware of that part of the statute until The Connecticut Mirror and ProPublica brought it to his attention last fall as part of an <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/connecticut-dmv-tow-companies-car-sales">investigation into how Connecticut’s laws favor towing companies</a> at the expense of drivers. After the story’s publication, the state treasurer’s office audited its deposits and determined that no tow truck company or the DMV had ever turned over money from sales in the history of the law.</p>

<p>In a statement, Guerrera said, “This law has been in effect since the 1930’s, yet unfortunately, there has never been a system in place to effectively monitor its implementation.”</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            Tony Guerrera, the commissioner of the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles, told lawmakers the state doesn’t have a system to ensure that towing companies turn over the unclaimed profits from car sales.
    
            (Shahrzad Rasekh/The Connecticut Mirror)
    
    
    

    

        
    
                    
<p>This failure has hurt both vehicle owners and the state itself: Owners don’t have the opportunity to get money back that the law says should be theirs, and the state is missing out on both the potential payments and any interest or investment income that would accrue from the deposits.</p>

<p>The unenforced law is another example of how the DMV has failed to oversee the towing industry, which sells thousands of cars following tows each year. In an extreme case, reported by the news organizations last month, a DMV employee was found to be part of a scheme to <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/connecticut-dmv-employee-sells-towed-cars">undervalue cars and sell them for thousands in profit</a>, according to an internal DMV investigation. The employee denied he did anything wrong and still works at the DMV. </p>

<p>In another, criminal court records show, a Norwalk towing company owner was caught driving a Mercedes-Benz he had towed, racking up nearly 6,000 miles in 22 months. The tower was charged with larceny and participated in a diversion program, after which his record was expunged. CT Mirror and ProPublica have spoken to dozens of people who had their cars towed and never saw them again. Many said they weren’t notified that their cars would be sold.</p>

<p>Legislators are now aiming to create a system to make sure car owners — or eventually the state — get that money. A <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/2025/TOB/H/PDF/2025HB-07162-R00-HB.PDF">wide-ranging bill</a> to <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/connecticut-lawmakers-seek-overhaul-of-towing-laws">overhaul the entire towing statute</a> would require towing companies to submit documentation to the DMV of the sale price, any towing and storage fees they incurred and information on the vehicle and its owner within 15 days of a sale.</p>

<p>The bill would also reform the process of “escheating,” or remitting money to the state. After reviewing the sale document, the DMV would require the tower to send a certified letter notifying the owner or lienholder of the sales proceeds. Instead of the general fund, leftover money would be sent to the state’s unclaimed property fund and appear on a publicly posted list.</p>

<p>Guerrera said the DMV recently added more staff charged with overseeing the sales system and added a section to its website this year to ensure tow companies are aware of the requirement to turn money over to the state.</p>

<p>During an interview late last year, Guerrera said that implementing the process wasn’t the DMV’s responsibility and that doing so was up to the state treasurer’s office. But the treasurer pushed back on that in a statement, saying it fell under DMV rules. After the initial CT Mirror and ProPublica story was published, Guerrera took more ownership.</p>

<p>“I am glad this has been brought to my attention and I am more than prepared to address this issue, ensuring that it is now being handled properly and in accordance with its intended purposes,” he said in a statement.</p>

<p>The Transportation Committee approved the bill on March 19, sending it to the House. Some lawmakers opposed it, arguing the bill was intended to target a “few bad apples” but adds unnecessary regulations on all towing companies.</p>

<p>House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said he expects lots of debate as the bill winds its way through the legislature, but he said the escheating process needs to be addressed.</p>

<p>“There’s got to be some accountability and transparency on that for sure,” Ritter said. “This is people’s property.”</p>

<p>Timothy Vibert, president of Towing and Recovery Professionals of Connecticut, said a past association president asked DMV officials about how to return funds to the state but received no answers.</p>

<p>He said tow companies rarely make back their towing and storage fees when they sell cars and questioned why any tower would ever give the state money.</p>

<p>“There might have been a little bit of a windfall with one car or another, but there’s been a whole lot of losers, so why does the state get a chance to take it?” asked Vibert, who owns Farmington Motor Sports. </p>

<p>He added that many towers would rather return the cars.</p>

<p>“What the towers are doing is keeping those cars and then just getting rid of them for $500 or $600,” Vibert added. “So we’re keeping the cars for, I’m going to guess 45 days, maybe sometimes 50, depending on the paperwork, and then we’re just disposing of them because they’re not worth anything.”</p>

<p>House Minority Leader Vincent Candelora, R-North Branford, said he thinks there usually isn’t money left over after fees. “I think, frankly, what usually happens is the tow companies wait for the towing and storage fees to exceed the value, so it never ends up going to the state or back to the individual,” he said.</p>

<p>Kristianne Hall experienced the fees piling up firsthand while she was bartending in downtown New Haven. The job posed a delicate balance. She had to work her shift and offer sufficient service to get good tips. But she also had to keep the parking meter fed. There were a few times Hall couldn’t get to the meter, and parking tickets stacked up.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            Kristianne Hall said she should have received thousands of dollars after her car was towed and sold, but she never got anything.

<p>In 2015, her car got booted and then towed when she couldn’t afford to pay the $500 to get the device taken off. By the time she had that money saved, she said, the towing company quoted her $2,000 to get the vehicle back from its lot.</p>

<p>Hall couldn’t afford that and never saw the car again. She estimated the 2008 Chevrolet Aveo was worth about $5,000, which is supported by a Kelley Blue Book report, thousands more than what the towing company told her she’d need to pay to get it back.</p>

<p>“Why was I not entitled to the rest of that money if I own that car outright?” she asked.</p>

<p>After the tow, Hall struggled to get to and from work. She had to take an Uber home because the city bus stopped running before her shifts ended. She quickly ran low on money and had to turn to her roommates to help her pay bills before she eventually moved in with her grandparents in Florida.</p>

<p>“I felt like a failure because I couldn’t hack it,” Hall said. “It was a really, really hard and almost traumatic situation.”</p>

                                                          <p>Heavy rainfall has been affecting Kinshasa, the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, since 4 April, causing flooding and landslides that have resulted in casualties and damage. According to the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), as of 7 April, 33 people have died and 46 were injured due to the overflow of the Ndjili River, affecting 13 out of 24 municipalities in Kinshasa city area. Media reports further indicate that several roads and houses have been destroyed or damaged, power outages have been recorded, and the water supply has been cut off. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4144934">ECHO, 8 Apr 2025</a>)</p>
<p>Following floods, the Ndjili river overflow, and landslides that occurred across 13 municipalities (out of 24) of the Kinshasa capital city (western Democratic Republic of the Congo) over the period from 4 to 11 April, the number of casualties has increased, and widespread damage was reported. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) reports, as of 13 April, 165 fatalities, 28 injured persons, more than 7,000 displaced people (a number of these across four relief sites) and a total of over 60,000 affected people across the Kinshasa capital city area. In addition, the IFRC also reports several destroyed and damaged houses. The UNOSAT was activated on 11 April and the International Charter was activated on 10 April to provide the damage assessment. Over the next 96 hours, more rainfall is still forecast over the already affected Kinshasa area. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4146232">ECHO, 14 Apr 2025</a>)</p>
<p>Severe flooding triggered by torrential rains in recent weeks has displaced almost 10,000 people in Tanganyika Province, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This unfolding emergency reflects the double crisis facing the DRC, where extreme weather shocks such as flooding compound the suffering caused by ongoing conflict and mass displacement. The Rugumba River burst its banks, inundating large areas of Kalemie and Nyunzu territories. Homes, schools and agricultural land have been destroyed, leaving thousands without shelter or livelihoods. Stagnant and contaminated floodwaters are raising concerns over the risk of disease outbreaks, with reported cholera cases in the province already six times higher than during the same period last year. The flooding has hit a community already under severe strain. Since January, Tanganyika has received around 50,000 internally displaced people (IDPs) fleeing violence in South Kivu. Many had been sheltering in local homes, churches, and schools—now damaged or destroyed. The floods also wiped out key crops like cassava, maize, and peanuts, worsening an already serious food insecurity situation in the country.

                                                          <p>A strong earthquake of 7.7 M at a depth of 10 km occurred on 28 March at 06.20 UTC (12.50 local time) in Sagaing Region, central Myanmar. The epicentre was located about 16 km north-north-west of Sagaing city, and 19 km north-west of Mandalay city. An aftershock of 6.4 M at a depth of 10 km occurred in the same area at 06.32 UTC. Sagaing is home to 1.3 million internally displaced persons (IDPs) – a third of all IDPs in Myanmar. USGS PAGER estimates that up to 7,000 people were exposed to violent shaking, up to 2,866,000 people to severe shaking, and up to 10,190,000 exposed to strong and very strong shaking. According to media reports, several buildings collapsed in Mandalay city, and buckling roads have been observed in Naypyidaw, the capital of Myanmar. The earthquake was felt in Bangkok and Chiang Mai cities in Thailand, where people have been evacuated from buildings, and in Yunnan and Shaanxi provinces in China. Aftershocks are continuing to be felt across the country. Myanmar has the fifth highest number of people in need of humanitarian assistance globally – 20 million, or about a third of the country. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4142703">ECHO, 28 Mar 2025</a>)</p>
<p>As of 29 March 2025, the official death toll stood at over 1,600, with 3,408 people injured and over 200 people missing. According to early modelling by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the final death toll could surpass 10,000 people. Initial estimates indicate that 18.3 million people, 4.04 million households, and USD 77.5 billion in infrastructure are concentrated within the affected area. The earthquake compounds the protracted crisis generated by armed conflict, political instability and disasters (large-scale flooding and heatwaves in 2024, among others). [...] In Sagaing Township, it is reported that over 70% of structures have sustained significant damage. Many residential buildings have either completely collapsed or were severely damaged. Two bridges between the Yangon – Naypyidaw highways were reported as being damaged, risking the disruption of critical transportation routes between Yangon and the most affected regions. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4143028/">IFRC, 30 Mar 2025</a>)</p>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that as of 30 March, there are a total of 2,601 fatalities due to the earthquake, 1,790 in Mandalay city, 402 in the capital Naypyidaw, 314 in Sagaing city, 79 in Southern Shan state, 35 in Bago city, and 3,408 injured people. The worst affected areas are Bago, Magway, Mandalay, Naypyidaw, Shan South and East and Sagaing. Three hospitals have been destroyed and 22 have been partially damaged. According to media, as of 29 March, in Bangkok city area in Thailand, 17 people died, 83 are still missing and 32 have been injured due to a collapsed building. In Ruili city, in southeastern Yunnan province, in China, bordering eastern Myanmar, 2,840 people have been affected and 847 houses have been damaged.  (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4143097/">ECHO, 31 Mar 2025</a>)</p>
<p>As of 1 April, media reports more than 3,000 fatalities. The worst affected area is Mandalay city with nearly 1,800 fatalities. UN OCHA and MSF report over 300 people still missing, some 3,900 injured, and more than 13,000 displaced across the country. More than 10,000 buildings collapsed or were severely damaged. The Myanmar military has continued to conduct air strikes against civilians in the aftermath of the earthquake – the military seized power in a coup in 2021 and the country is in active conflict. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4143342/">ECHO, 1 Apr 2025</a>)</p>
<p>As of 3 April, media reports 3,085 fatalities, 4,715 injured people, still 341 missing people. The AHA Centre reports that 21,783 houses have been affected, of which 15,114 have been destroyed, and that the state of emergency remains in effect for Mandalay, Sagaing Magway, Shan State, Naypyidaw, and Bago areas. Media also reports that the military government declared a temporary ceasefire to facilitate humanitarian support for the affected people. Several opposition forces had already said they would stop hostilities in the wake of the earthquake. According to the Asian Disaster Reduction Center (ADRC) report, in Thailand 20 fatalities, 35 injured people and 771 affected houses have been recorded. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4143801/">ECHO, 3 Apr 2025</a>)</p>
<p>The AHA Centre reports that as of 6 April, there are approximately 3,500 fatalities, 210 missing persons, more than 5,000 injured people, and around 69,100 displaced people, with the worst affected area being the Mandalay region. UN OCHA also reports over 17 million affected people across the country. [...] Despite a ceasefire announced on 2 April, over 30 attacks have been reported as taking place since then, including in earthquake-affected areas. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4144520/">ECHO, 7 Apr 2025</a>)</p>
<p>As of 8 April, media reports indicate over 3,600 deaths, 160 missing persons, 5,017 injured, and approximately 69,100 displaced individuals. The Mandalay region has been the hardest hit, while UN OCHA estimates that over 17.2 million people have been affected across the impacted areas. Humanitarian partners, supported by DG ECHO, are providing aid on the ground. In neighbouring Thailand, the earthquake has caused 23 fatalities and 36 injuries, according to the Asian Disaster Reduction Center (ADRC), with the Bangkok city area being the most severely affected. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4144931/">ECHO, 8 Apr 2025</a>)</p>
<p>More than 9 million people (including 2.7 million children) are estimated to be the worst affected across 58 townships in Bago East, Kayin, Magway, Mandalay, Nay Pyi Taw, Shan South, and Sagaing. Latest reports indicate continued infrastructure damage which include 193 healthcare facilities, and 2,311 schools.  There is a growing concern among communities about the risk of infectious diseases, due to improperly managed corpses and the lack of access to safe water and sanitation facilities. A cluster of mild to moderate acute watery diarrhoea (AWD) cases has been reported in Sagaing Township and urban areas of Mandalay. WASH cluster partners have so far identified over 42,000 damaged latrines and report significant damage to urban water systems and rural aquifers. Extreme heat - reaching 44°C (111°F) – and off-season rains are further exacerbating the situation for responders and survivors, many of whom are still sleeping outdoors. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4145337/">UNICEF, 9 Apr 2025</a>)</p>
<p>The death toll continues to rise in Myanmar and Thailand following the strong 7.7 magnitude earthquake that struck near Mandalay city on 28 March. In the past seven days, at least five additional earthquakes up to 4.8 magnitude have been recorded between Mandalay and the capital, Naypyidaw. In Myanmar, the AHA Centre reports 3,603 fatalities, 141 people still missing, and 4,817 injured. Nearly 200,000 people are currently displaced, with 40,896 of them staying in 127 temporary shelters. In Thailand, 30 people have died and 38 others have been injured. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4145863">ECHO, 11 Apr 2025</a>)</p>
<p>A new earthquake of 5.5 M at a depth of 7.7 km occurred on 13 April at 02.24 UTC (08.54 local time) in the Mandalay region of central Myanmar. The epicentre was located about 34 km north-northeast of Meiktila city and 78 km south of Mandalay city. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) PAGER estimates that up to 86,000 people were exposed to severe shaking, while 631,000 were exposed to strong and very strong shaking. According to the AHA Centre, as of 12 April, the death toll continues to rise in both Myanmar and Thailand. In Myanmar, there are 3,648 fatalities, 134 missing people, and 4,817 injured people, with approximately 200,000 displaced, of whom 42,118 are in 134 temporary shelters. In Thailand, 42 people have died and 38 others have been injured. OCHA Myanmar, the WHO, and the UNEP/OCHA Joint Environment Unit have requested assistance from the Union Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM). Six EU Member States have offered shelter and medical items. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4146229/">ECHO, 14 Apr 2025</a>)</p>
<p>With 640 healthcare facilities now registered as damaged and remaining health facilities overwhelmed and reporting critical shortages of medical supplies [...] Many families are still sleeping outside – exposed to extreme heat and off-season rains (which have already started), as well as vector-borne diseases, including dengue and malaria. [...] There has been widespread destruction of water systems, including broken boreholes and damaged piped networks, along with the collapse of over 76,000 latrines. There is a growing concern among communities about the risk of infectious diseases due to improperly managed corpses and the lack of access to safe water and sanitation facilities. A cluster of mild to moderate acute watery diarrhoea (AWD) cases has been reported in Sagaing township and urban areas of Mandalay, though no cases of cholera have been confirmed to date. [...] More than 2,600 schools have reportedly been damaged. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4146991/">UNICEF, 16 Apr 2025</a>)</p>
<p>Central Myanmar continues to experience frequent seismic activity almost daily. Since the destructive quakes, more than 140 aftershocks have been recorded, including two with 5.9 and 5.5 magnitude tremors near Nay Pyi Taw Union Territory and Wundwin Town on 29 March and 13 April, according to the Department of Meteorology and Hydrology. The United States Geological Survey indicates that aftershocks may persist for months following a major earthquake, especially in tectonically active regions like Myanmar. To date, 3,700 deaths have been reported, 4,800 people injured and 129 people remain missing, according to the ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management (AHA Centre). The real toll is likely much higher, with challenges in data collection, verification and processing and underreporting making it difficult to grasp the full scale of the disaster.

More than 300,000 people are affected, primarily due to the suspension of potable water in the area. The lack of safe access to water increases the risk of disease and heightens vulnerabilities and needs in affected communities that are already highly marginalized. On 20 March, the Government officially requested support from the United Nations, specifically noting the Joint Environment Unit (JEU) and UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC). The situation is further exacerbated by ongoing security challenges in Esmeraldas, one of the provinces most affected by the national security crisis, while heavy rains continue to hinder response efforts. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4140985/">OCHA, 20 Mar 2025</a>)</p>
<p>The rupture of the SOTE Pipeline on 13 March 2025 in the province of Esmeraldas caused, according to official sources, a spill of more than 25,000 barrels of oil, extending 86 km and affecting 11 parishes. Some 500,000 people have been affected by limited access to safe potable water, with serious health consequences, including respiratory conditions and exposure to toxic gases. The affected areas of the crisis face high violence, with the presence of criminal groups, raising concerns about the security situation. Provincial and cantonal EOCs have been activated, but gaps persist in the water, health, food security, and livelihood sectors. A state of emergency due to a natural disaster was declared throughout the province of Esmeraldas on 26 March. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4142809">OCHA, 27 Mar 2025</a>)</p>

Major cities such as Al Anbar, Erbil, Al Qadisiyyah, Diyala, and Thi Qar were affected, flooding streets, causing road disruptions, and the suspension of basic services, most notably sewage, power plants, potable water, and communications. Due to the severity of its impact, most governorates were forced to suspend the official working hours of schools and universities in order to ensure the safety of citizens. In Baghdad, the heavy rainfall, which measured over 72 millimetres in just one hour, far surpassed the city's infrastructure limits, which can handle only between 24 and 38 millimetres per hour. Residential areas and roads were inundated, leading to traffic chaos and property damage. The Kurdistan Region also experienced widespread flooding, with reports of homes and businesses being affected. Authorities have been working to manage the emergency, but the scale of the flooding has overwhelmed local resources. Heavy flooding was also reported in Babil and Karbala governorates, where main roads are submerged, particularly in the cities.

<p>The weather system is forecasted to linger over Nampula province until the evening of 10 March, bringing with it heavy rains – exceeding 250 mm in 24 hours – accompanied by severe thunderstorms that could trigger floods in the provinces of Nampula, Zambezia, Cabo Delgado, and Sofala (WFP ADAM flood forecast). The Hydrological Department issued a flooding alert in the areas along the main river basins of Nampula, and localized flooding has been reported in Nacala and Ilha de Moçambique districts.</p>
<p>Initial reports from partners in the field indicate the impact of the cyclone on houses, public infrastructure including roads, electricity and telecommunication lines. INGD and IOM-DTM teams were pre-deployed in the districts and are on standby for rapid needs assessments in areas that will be accessible.</p>
<p>At least 780,468 people are at very high and high risk across the provinces of the cyclone’s track, among them the 508,167 people in Nampula province and 272,302 people in Zambezia province. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4138630/">OCHA, 10 Mar 2025</a>)</p>
<p>Mozambique’s National Institute for Disaster Management (INGD) reports that as of 19 March, the total number of people affected stood at 390,000 people with 16 deaths. More than 88,000 houses were completely and partially destroyed. In terms of public infrastructure, 81 health units and 272 schools, 20 bridges and 43 water systems were affected. 73 kms of electricity wires have been damaged.</p>

                                                          <p>On 6 March, the National Meteorological Service, through its Early Warning System, established the Orange Alert Level for storms for the southern region of the Province of Buenos Aires. Given that this represented a dangerous phenomenon for society, life, property and the environment, both the municipal authorities and different community institutions took preventive measures such as the suspension of classes, cancellation of outdoor activities and reinforcements in risk communication.</p>
<p>In the early hours of the morning of 7 March, the Bahía Blanca District, located on the southern coast of the province, experienced intense and prolonged rains, reaching a total of more than 300 mm in a sustained period of six hours. During the morning, the official agency raised the Alert Level to Red, in view of the short-term forecasts that foresaw the continuity of rainfall, with an expected accumulation of an additional 100 mm. The course of the Napostá stream, which crosses the city, did not have enough capacity to guarantee adequate rainfall runoff, which caused an overflow that generated significant impacts in 70% of the area.</p>
<p>In terms of its impact, the flood caused partial and total damage to the infrastructure of homes and businesses, light poles, walls, trees and signs, causing extensive material losses and interruptions in essential services such as medical care, transportation, electricity, gas, fuel, telecommunications and water supply.</p>
<p>The flood affected the vast majority of the community, both in urban and peri-urban areas, with the most affected areas being those in the east and southeast of the district. Many households experienced water inflow that has reached heights of two meters in some regions, including in the urban centre. Although approximately 50% of the affected areas have been drained, the recovery process is expected to take several weeks in some cases. Thus, particularly vulnerable areas such as the towns of General Cerri and Ingeniero White continue to face flooding challenges due to their geographical location, pre-existing drainage problems and high levels of vulnerability. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4140605/">IFRC, 19 Mar 2025</a>)</p>
<p>In northern Argentina, the overflowing Pilcomayo and Bermejo rivers has caused significant floods and flash floods, resulting in significant damage and power outages in Salta province, particularly the Chaco region of Salta. The situation is worsened by intense winds exceeding 100 km/h.</p>
<p>As of 31 March, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies reports that 2,000 people have been affected. Local authorities activated emergency protocols and conducted immediate evacuations in high-risk areas. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4143344/">ECHO, 01 Apr 2025</a>)</p>

Many villages remain isolated, thousands of people are still without electricity, and emergency responders are facing serious challenges in reaching those in need.</p>
<p>In Guria, snowdrifts continue to block roads, leaving villages like Chokhatauri, Gogole District, and Ozurgeti cut off from essential supplies. Residents of Buknari, Kvenobani, and Basileti remain stranded, while people in Jumati, Konchati, and Kokati face food shortages and worsening conditions. With ongoing snowfall, there is still no clear timeframe for when access to these areas will be restored.</p>
<p>In Imereti, around 30,000 people are still without electricity, and 149 villages remain inaccessible. Schools remain closed, and relief efforts are slowed down by the extreme weather. In Adjara, conditions have not improved, as Batumi continues to face power outages and mobility restrictions due to icy roads. In Khulo, Shuakhevi, and Keda, nearly 20 villages remain surrounded by snow, and some homes are still buried. Reports indicate a serious lack of food, medical supplies, and heating, while avalanche risks remain high.</p>
<p>The death toll stands at 3 (three), with recent reports confirming that people have died from collapsed roofs, unavailability of essential medicines, and lack of timely medical access. Emergency responders and military personnel are still working to clear roads and evacuate people from the hardest-hit areas, but the ongoing snowfall makes their work extremely difficult.

On January 8th, over 30 suspected cases of cholera were recorded in the same area of Luanda province. The rapid escalation of suspected cases indicates potential for a continued worsening outbreak. Other areas of concern noted by Ministry of Health include the northern provinces that border DRC, where outbreaks of cholera have been reported in the past. Combined with heavy rainfall, poor sanitation and limited access to clean water, the risk of floods and water-borne diseases is exacerbated. INAMET - National Institute of Meteorology and Geophysics - predicts above-average rainfall for the current rainy season. Flood risk for Angola is high during this period of time. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4124188">IFRC, 10 Jan 2025</a>)</p>
<p>By January 11th, 170 suspected cases were recorded with 30 conrmed cases across 3 provinces (Luanda, Bengo, Icolo &amp; Bengo). By
January 17th, 422 cases have been reported with 24 deaths leading to a high case fatality rate (5.7%) (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4127486">IFRC, 21 Jan 2025</a>)</p>

Title    : Ethiopia: Earthquakes - Jan 2025
Published: Sat, 04 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000
Summary  :
<div class="tag country">Affected country: Ethiopia</div>
                                      <div class="tag glide">Glide: EQ-2025-000001-ETH</div>
                                                          <p>The Fentale volcanic complex in the Main Ethiopian Rift has seen increased seismic activity since October 2024. In late December 2024, earthquake frequency spiked with several magnitude 5 events, accompanied by the opening of steam vents (releasing steam and gases from underground). This surge is believed to be linked to magma movement, though it’s uncertain whether an eruption will occur and from which volcano or vent—in Fentale, Dofen, or a new location. Between 4 and 6 January, over 20 earthquakes have struck the Awash Fentale area, with the strongest, a magnitude 5.8, occurring on January 4 near the Dofen mountains. This tremor caused significant damage to the Kesem Sugar Factory, highlighting the destructive potential of the ongoing seismic activity. Approximately 80,000 people are affected across the two regions—60,000 in Afar and 20,000 in Oromia—and many residents are uncertain about the appropriate actions to take. About 30,000 people have already relocated, and the government is working to evacuate another 50,000 people. There is an urgent need for the provision of food and water trucking to meet the immediate needs of the displaced population. Three relocation sites have been identified in the Awash district: Daido, Asbole Boda, and Medala; four sites in Dulecha district: Garrayto, Hadale Abur, Gudili, and Daido; and eight sites in Oromia: Tututi, Turo, Gidara, Alge, Galcha, Fateledi, Sarawayba and Matahara town. The government is considering reducing the number of sites. No casualties have been reported; however, significant damage has occurred to infrastructure, including homes, health centers, schools and roads. Widening fissures are affecting several roads and there are concerns about the nearby Kesam/Sabure Dam. Although it is designed to withstand earthquakes up to a magnitude of 5.6, it holds a significant volume of water, and any failure could result in catastrophic flooding downstream, potentially affecting hundreds of thousands of people. Scientific assessments are ongoing, but predictions remain uncertain. The cumulative impact of these earthquakes underscores the need for urgent measures to assess and address the vulnerability of local infrastructure. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4123473">OCHA, 6 Jan 2025</a>)</p>
<p>Seismic activity continues across parts of Afar and Oromia, particularly in Awash and Dulecha districts. Between 8 and 10 January, 18 earthquakes, ranging from 4.4 to 5.3 in magnitude, have been recorded, bringing the total number of tremors to about 50 in the past week. The strongest, a magnitude 5.8, occurring at a depth of 10km, on 4 January, near the Dofen mountains. Its effects were felt as far away as the capital city, Addis Ababa. [...] In Afar, local authorities report that 51,456 people have been registered and partially evacuated to two designated sites. In Oromia, authorities note that around 20,325 individuals have moved from the Fentale district to 11 informal IDPs sites, including schools and other facilities. Evacuating pastoralist communities is particularly challenging due to their concerns about abandoning their livestock, which are vital to their livelihoods, as well as the potential disruption of their communal connections. In some cases, heads of households are staying behind to care for their property. Movement continues, and all sites are still receiving IDPs. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4124435">OCHA, 10 Jan 2025</a>)</p>
<p>The intense seismic activity that has been affecting the southern Afar and northern Oromia regions, near the Fentale and the Dofan volcanoes in the Main Ethiopian Rift, continues. About 50 earthquakes of magnitude 4.2 to 5.8 have been recorded between 4 and 10 January 2025; the most recent one, of 5.2 M, was reported on 11 January at 00:19 UTC (03:19 local time) at a depth of 10 km, approximately 160 km north-eastern of Addis Ababa. According to UN OCHA, as of 11 January, at least two people have been injured by the seismic activity, more than 60,000 people have been evacuated, including 51,456 registered and partially evacuated in Afar and 20,325 in Oromia, and emergency shelters have been set up. Significant damage has also been recorded, with 16 schools severely damaged, and 21 partially. (<a href="https://reliefweb.int/node/4124659">ECHO, 13 Jan 2025</a>)</p>
<p>An earthquake of 5.5 M at a depth of 10 km occurred in southern Afar region, central Ethiopia on 16 March at 18.53 UTC (21.53 local time). The epicentre was located 4 km south-east of Fentale volcano and 43 km north of Awash city in southern Afar region. An aftershock of 4.3 M hit the same area on 16 March at 22.20 UTC. USGS PAGER estimates that up to 6,000 people were exposed to severe shaking, 26,000 to very strong shaking and 14,000 to strong shaking. Since December 2024, this area between the Fentale and Dofan volcanoes, in southern Afar and northern Oromia regions, has been experiencing intense seismic activity with earthquakes that reached up to 6.0 M. More than 80,000 people have evacuated the affected areas since January and several infrastructures have been severely damaged.

Title    : Air Quality Alert issued April 23 at 1:28PM EDT by NWS Upton NY
Published: 2025-04-23T13:28:00-04:00
Summary  :
The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has
issued an Air Quality Health Advisory for the following counties:

New York, Bronx, Kings, Queens, Richmond, Nassau, Suffolk,
Westchester, Rockland.

from midnight tonight to midnight EDT Thursday night.

Air quality levels in outdoor air are predicted to be greater than
an Air Quality Index value of 100 for the pollutant of Fine
Particulates. The Air Quality Index, or AQI, was created as an easy
way to correlate levels of different pollutants to one scale. The
higher the AQI value, the greater the health concern.

When pollution levels are elevated, the New York State Department of
Health recommends that individuals consider limiting strenuous
outdoor physical activity to reduce the risk of adverse health
effects. People who may be especially sensitive to the effects of
elevated levels of pollutants include the very young, and those with
preexisting respiratory problems such as asthma or heart disease.
Those with symptoms should consider consulting their personal
physician.

A toll free air quality hotline has been established so New York
residents can stay informed on the air quality situation. The toll
free number is 1 800 5 3 5, 1 3 4 5.

Title    : Air Quality Alert issued April 23 at 1:10PM EDT by NWS Upton NY
Published: 2025-04-23T13:10:00-04:00
Summary  :
The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation has
issued an Air Quality Health Advisory for the following counties:

New York, Bronx, Kings, Queens, Richmond, Nassau, Suffolk,
Westchester, Rockland, Orange, Putnam.

from midnight tonight to midnight EDT Thursday night.

Air quality levels in outdoor air are predicted to be greater than
an Air Quality Index value of 100 for the pollutant of Fine
Particulates. The Air Quality Index, or AQI, was created as an easy
way to correlate levels of different pollutants to one scale. The
higher the AQI value, the greater the health concern.

When pollution levels are elevated, the New York State Department of
Health recommends that individuals consider limiting strenuous
outdoor physical activity to reduce the risk of adverse health
effects. People who may be especially sensitive to the effects of
elevated levels of pollutants include the very young, and those with
preexisting respiratory problems such as asthma or heart disease.
Those with symptoms should consider consulting their personal
physician.

A toll free air quality hotline has been established so New York
residents can stay informed on the air quality situation. The toll
free number is 1 800 5 3 5, 1 3 4 5.

      <p style="line-height: 12.0pt; margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-US">The South Sudanese army recaptured the town of Nasir on 19 April, in a setback for the opposition militia that had&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/africa/horn-africa/south-sudan/south-sudan-precipice-renewed-full-blown-war"><span lang="EN-US">seized it</span></a><span lang="EN-US"> in early March, amid the first stirrings of renewed civil war. The opposition stronghold in eastern Upper Nile state fell without resistance in the aftermath of a major battle the previous week in Doma, in nearby Ulang county, which caused heavy casualties, including a reported death toll of hundreds on both sides. Known as the White Army, the ethnic Nuer opposition militia has loose links to Riek Machar, a former rebel leader who is currently first vice president. The Ugandan air force, meanwhile, has backed South Sudanese government forces against the rebels. Uganda’s president, Yoweri Museveni, is a firm ally of Machar’s foe, South Sudanese President Salva Kiir.</span></p><p style="line-height: 12.0pt; margin-bottom: 0in; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-US">It is unclear for now whether the recapture of Nasir will bring an end to the surge in conflict in the Upper Nile, but chances are that more violence is on the way. The White Army appears to have pulled back rather than face another costly battle. It may simply be a matter of time before hostilities resume, with more White Army militias mobilising nearby, especially in the Fangak area of northern Jonglei state, where they have been fighting government forces south west of Upper Nile state’s capital, Malakal</span><span lang="EN-US">.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="line-height: 12.0pt; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-US">Rising violence in the Upper Nile appears to have helped push South Sudan’s chronically factious politics to the breaking point. Long-time rivals Kiir and Machar had previously plunged the country into civil war in 2013, before signing an agreement in 2018 to form a coalition government. In late March, as fighting was getting worse in the Upper Nile, Kiir arrested key opposition figures, invited the Ugandan military to deploy to South Sudan on his behalf, placed Machar under formal house arrest in Juba and launched new attacks on positions held by Machar’s allies in several spots around the country. The war in neighbouring Sudan could also exacerbate the conflict in the Upper Nile: while Kiir has a loose connection to the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, the Sudanese army might reconnect with opposition groups in the Upper Nile that have acted as its proxies in the past.</span></p><p style="line-height: 12.0pt; text-align: justify;"><span lang="EN-US">Other parts of South Sudan are also being shaken by fresh unrest. Force alone is unlikely to enable Juba to extinguish these flare-ups of discontent. Nor can Kiir turn to the traditional playbook of paying off rivals, due to a fiscal crisis caused by the breakdown of South Sudan’s main oil export pipeline, a result of the fighting in Sudan. Costly military occupation of Nasir and Ulang, predominantly Nuer localities, will only deepen resentment. Meanwhile, Kiir has declined mediation offers from African partners, even blocking outsiders from speaking to Machar directly. South Sudanese elites widely talk of resurgent civil war, even as they debate what shape and form it might take.&nbsp;</span></p>

One long-time U.S. government Yemen watcher laughed when asked whether the renewed strikes would deter the Houthis or otherwise halt attacks. They noted that the Houthis had learned and adapted from prior experience being bombed by the Saudi-led coalition and the U.S. And indeed, Houthi attacks have&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/houthi-missile-triggers-sirens-in-central-israel-is-downed-en-route/"><span lang="EN-GB">persisted</span></a><span lang="EN-GB">.&nbsp;</span></p><p style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span lang="EN-GB">Another set of questions concerns legal authority. The White House is conducting this campaign without congressional authorisation. The administration has&nbsp;</span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bcfinucane.bsky.social/post/3lng46olpnc2c"><span lang="EN-GB">seemingly adopted</span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.crisisgroup.org/united-states/009-bending-guardrails-us-war-powers-after-7-october"><span lang="EN-GB">Biden team’s legal theories</span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> for waging the conflict indefinitely, notwithstanding constitutional restrictions, and a 60-day time limit on unauthorised executive branch action imposed by the War Powers Resolution. Conversations with U.S. officials suggest that the current administration (like the last) holds that U.S. strikes are defensive and thus don’t fit within the statutory language that would trigger the Resolution’s 60-day clock. That language requires an “introduction” of U.S. forces into hostilities.</span></p><p style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span lang="EN-GB">Thirdly, the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/"><span lang="EN-GB">“SignalGate” chat</span></a><span lang="EN-GB"> raises serious questions about the decision-making process for uses of force within the U.S. executive branch. Ordinarily, such a decision would be taken by the U.S. president after hearing from his top national security officials – including the secretary of defense, chairman of the joint staff, secretary of state, national security advisor, and vice president – and then memorialised in writing. It is far from clear that such a meeting happened. Although the chat suggested there was some conversation, it is ambiguous about who was there, and what the president himself authorised. The deputy chief of staff seems to have ended the Signal debate over whether or when to strike the Houthis with the intervention “[a]s I heard it, the president was clear: green light”. But green light for what? And if the president was clear, why all the post-meeting chatter?</span></p><p style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span lang="EN-GB">As the administration nears the 100-day mark, these questions about strategy, legal authority, and decision-making could have implications beyond Yemen.</span></p>

Title    : FIFA Has No Child Safeguarding Policy for 2026 World Cup

<p>In two months, the FIFA Club World Cup, an international football tournament for club teams, will kick off in the United States, serving as a testing ground for the 2026 FIFA Men’s World Cup next year. But FIFA has inexcusably not put a clear and comprehensive child safeguarding framework in place to protect children from harms at these two massive sporting events, which will attract millions of visitors.</p><p>Risks that children can face in the context of major sporting events include trafficking,&nbsp;sexual exploitation, child labor, and family displacements, among other forms of&nbsp;violence and abuse. Despite knowing these risks, FIFA has not published a Child Safeguarding policy for the 2026 World Cup: what will probably be the largest and most lucrative sporting event ever.</p><p>In 2018, FIFA awarded the US, Canada, and Mexico hosting rights to the 2026 World Cup, in part due to the new requirement for bidding countries to create a Human Rights Strategy. That strategy promised to “develop and implement child safeguarding protocols.” Such a policy should address dangers for kids, gaps in domestic laws, and coordination across sixteen cities in three countries.</p><p>Seven years on, these promises have been ignored: and the protection of children who will travel to, attend, watch, and live in the communities hosting does not appear to be a FIFA priority.</p><p>FIFA has&nbsp;watered down its promised human rights framework, and there is currently no comprehensive policy in place to protect youth.</p><p>A new report, “Keeping the Game Safe,” by the&nbsp;University of Miami School of Law Human Rights Clinic and the&nbsp;Centre for Sport and Human Rights, maps risks to children at mega-sporting events, with concrete recommendations for FIFA and 2026 hosts.</p><p>Event organizers should put in place mandatory safeguarding training, binding child protection standards, designate trained and experienced safeguarding officers at each venue and host city, and implement a centralized reporting system. Venues should have child-centered design and stringent protections against child labor.</p><p>It is critical for FIFA to establish a uniform child safeguarding policy, applicable to all host cities in the US, Mexico, and Canada. This should take into account socioeconomic and legal contexts, as well as needs of communities and children at risk. Survivor groups and other local and national experts should be engaged in the development of this policy.</p><p>The 2026 World Cup needs to raise the bar for children’s rights, not lower it.</p>

<p><br />(Sydney) – Voters in the upcoming Australian election on May 3, 2025, should consider where political candidates stand on key human rights issues, Human Rights Watch said today. Before casting their ballots, voters should weigh the candidates’ commitments to respecting, protecting and fulfilling human rights within Australia and internationally.</p>  



      

  
  
    



  
        
  

          
        Human Rights Watch Questions to Australian Political Parties Ahead of May 2025 Election
      
      


  
<p>Human Rights Watch on April 4 sent a questionnaire to the three largest political parties in Australian federal elections – the Australian Labor Party, the Liberal National Coalition and the Australian Greens. All three parties responded.</p><p>“Australians face a range of issues affecting their human rights, including the cost of living, the climate crisis, refugee intake, and systemic injustices impacting First Nations people, including disproportionate incarceration and the forced separation of families in the child protection system,” said Annabel Hennessy, Australia researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The political parties provided Human Rights Watch their positions on these and other human rights issues that voters should consider when voting.”</p><p>Serious human rights violations persist in Australia, Human Rights Watch said. These include the government’s obligation to ensure everyone can enjoy their economic, social and cultural rights, such as the rights to food, health, education, and housing without discrimination.</p><p>The parties also responded to foreign policy questions that dealt with the International Criminal Court arrest warrants, targeted sanctions against Chinese officials, and the Australian nationals, including women and children, who remain detained in camps and prisons in Northeast Syria.</p><p>“With armed conflicts on the rise and foreign governments seeking to dismantle the international human rights framework, Australia’s election comes at a critical moment,” Hennessy said. “Voters should consider how candidates are pledging to respect and fulfill human rights at home and abroad.”</p><p>The compilation of responses&nbsp;to the questionnaire can be found on the Human Rights Watch website.</p>

What is your position on a national Human Rights Act?<p>The Australian Labor Party&nbsp;said “Human rights are to be enjoyed by all. The Albanese Government is committed to protecting the human rights of all Australians. Under Labor, Australia was an original signatory to the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. Labor defends and advances the principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration, both at home and abroad. The Albanese Government notes that Australia’s international obligations have been incorporated into domestic law to the extent necessary to implement Australia’s international human rights obligations. The Albanese Government has no plans to introduce a federal Human Rights Act.”</p><p>The Liberal National Coalition said “Australians can be proud of our country’s human rights record. Australia was one of the original signatories to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and has been a vocal advocate for human rights and freedoms, good governance and democratic institutions, particularly in our region. The Coalition has no plans to legislate a Human Rights Act.”</p><p>The Australian Greens&nbsp;said “The Greens will use the model Human Rights Act produced by the Parliament’s Human Rights Committee as the basis for a national Human Rights Bill 2025. This will protect essential civil and political rights like the right to life, to a fair trial and to be free from torture as well as the right to a safe environment, to education and social support.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Children’s Rights</p>The age of criminal responsibility in most jurisdictions in Australia, including under federal law, is 10 years. The United Nations recommended minimum age of responsibility is 14 years. What is your position on raising the age of responsibility and were you to raise it, what steps would you take to work with states and territories to implement this change?<p>The Australian Labor Party said “Australian state and territory governments have primary responsibility for child protection, justice and detention. Overwhelmingly, age of criminal responsibility reform is a matter for state and territory governments. The Albanese Government remains committed to reform that will enable communities to establish locally tailored initiatives that address the underlying causes of incarceration, including to reduce the contact of First Nations children with the justice system. This includes the establishment of our landmark National Justice Reinvestment Program.”</p><p>The Liberal National Coalition said “The Coalition strongly opposes raising the age of criminal responsibility. Commonwealth law only permits convictions for children between the ages of 10 and 14 where the child knows what they are doing is wrong, meaning that under current laws children under 14 can only be convicted where they are capable of being criminally responsible for an offence. The age of criminal responsibility at a state level is a matter for each jurisdiction”.</p><p>The Australian Greens&nbsp;said “Locking up children doesn’t solve problems—it creates them. The Greens are working to raise the age of legal responsibility and replace harmful practices with community-based support and culturally safe programs to give young people hope and a brighter future.</p><p>We will:</p>Work with the states and territories to the age of legal responsibility from 10 to 14, ensuring children are no longer criminalised for minor offences.Support young people in their communities by funding culturally safe diversionary programs, mental health services, and community corrections to keep children out of prison and address underlying issues.<p>Develop a roadmap for alternatives to youth detention by investing $50 million over four years in the Attorney General’s Department.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p>What actions will you take to incorporate data privacy protections, particularly for children, in Australia’s forthcoming artificial intelligence (AI) regulations so that individuals are protected from the misuse of their personal data in the development and use of AI?<p>The Australian Labor Party said “The Albanese Government will work to ensure that Australia is a leader in the safe and responsible adoption of AI technologies. The Government will continue to progress its response to the Privacy Act Review, which recognised that children are particularly vulnerable to online harms. This work will build community trust that privacy risks associated with the collection, use and disclosure of personal information, including in the adoption of AI, are being managed appropriately.</p><p>The Government’s landmark Privacy and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2024 (Cth) implemented the first tranche of proposals of the Privacy Act Review. The Act included a requirement for the Information Commissioner to develop and register a Children’s Online Privacy Code to better strengthen privacy protections for children. The Act also included measures to provide individuals with greater transparency about the use of their personal information in automated decisions which significantly affect their rights or interests. The Act laid the foundation for further important privacy reform, which will be guided by the Government’s response to the Privacy Act Review.</p><p>In this response, the Government agreed in principle to:</p>Require that the collection, use and disclosure of personal information be fair and reasonable in the circumstances,Prohibit trading in the personal information of a child,Prohibit targeting to a child, with the exception for targeting that is in the child’s best interests, andRequire that privacy settlings for online services should reflect the ‘privacy-by-default’ framework of the Privacy Act.<p>The Government will engage in targeted consultation on the remaining privacy proposals to inform a further tranche of privacy reform.”</p><p>The Australian Greens said “AI has enormous potential benefits, but it also has the potential to harm society, the economy, and our personal lives. The Greens are working to ensure that the benefits of AI are shared by all and that risks are managed, including through ensuring robust AI regulation. Our plan includes:</p>A new Independent AI Regulator and a Digital Rights Commissioner to oversee AI regulation and protect digital rights,Equip regulators such as the eSafety Commissioner with the resources and expertise needed to take down AI generated content which violates the rights of Australians, particularly children,New laws for Facial Recognition and surveillance technologies to protect Australians against the harmful uses of biometric technologies and ensure the protection of Australians’ privacy, andRequire sensitive personal data to be stored within Australia to safeguard against foreign exploitation.”<p>The Liberal National Coalition did not answer this question.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First Nations Peoples’ Rights</p>Currently, First Nations children in Australia are more than 10 times more likely than non-Indigenous children to be living in out-of-home care (when child protection authorities remove them from their parents and place them in another care setting). What is your plan to end the overrepresentation of First Nations children being removed from their parents by child protection authorities?<p>The Australian Labor Party said “The over-representation of First Nations children and young people in out-of-home care is not acceptable. The reasons for the over-representation are multi-faceted and complex, and include past government policies, discrimination, entrenched disadvantage and intergenerational trauma. Statutory child protection remains a state and territory government responsibility, but the Commonwealth Government has a key role to play in preventing families from coming into contact with child protection. We have established Australia’s first ever National Commissioner for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children and Young People, to protect and promote the rights, interests and wellbeing of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and young people across a range of issues including the over representation of Indigenous children in out of home care. The Commonwealth Government continues to work closely with First Nations leaders, the non-government sector and state and territory governments to reduce the over representation of First Nations children in out of home care through Safe and Supported: the National Framework for Protecting Australia’s Children 2021-2031, which includes Commonwealth investment of more than $98 million.”</p><p>The Liberal National Coalition said: “An elected Dutton Coalition Government will focus on practical action for Indigenous Australians, solutions to improve health outcomes for Indigenous women and children, boost law and order and provide more housing in Indigenous communities. We want to target and address the significant disadvantage and neglect within regional and remote Indigenous communities. We will reintroduce the Cashless Debit Card for working- aged welfare recipients in consultation with communities, to make sure children are getting the support from their parents that they deserve. We will increase opportunities for indigenous children in remote communities to access a quality education, with commonwealth support for boarding school facilities. These facilities play a vital role in building aspiration, as well as keeping teenagers off the streets and out of jail.”</p><p>The Australian Greens said “Child protection and removals is one of the ten issues marked as requiring urgent attention in the Australian Greens’ First Nations policy. Article 8.1 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) states that Indigenous people must not be subjected to forced assimilation or destruction of culture, and Outcome 12 in the Closing the Gap Agreement seeks to reduce the rate of over-representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in out-of-home care by 45% by 2031, from a 2019 baseline of 54.2 per 1,000 First Nations children. To achieve this target, governments must address the lack of cultural competency within mainstream services, the effects of intergenerational trauma, the mistrust of statutory child protection authorities created through decades of destructive policy, and the inadequacy of funding for services that can prevent child removal. Shared decision-making with communities and building the First Nations-led community-controlled sector will be essential. The Greens will provide $113 million in grants for schools to run diversionary programs specifically to get First Nations kids out on country, with Elders, to learn about and connect to culture, language and country as an option to provide holistic healing and growth instead of locking up kids in detention. These programs are to be community led, self-determined, trauma informed and spread across the country in line with the data on First Nations children in institutionalised care.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p>First Nations people are grossly overrepresented in Australia’s criminal justice system. Closing The Gap data has shown that the rate of First Nations people in prison has increased by 20 percent since 2019. In 2024, 2,300 First Nations people per 100,000 were incarcerated, compared with a non-Indigenous incarceration rate of 147 per 100,000. What is your plan to end the overrepresentation of First Nations people in Australia’s prisons?<p>The Australian Labor Party&nbsp;said “First Nations youth incarceration rates across the country are unacceptable. State and territory governments are responsible for the administration of juvenile justice systems. However, the Commonwealth government continues to show leadership on this important issue. The Albanese Government is working with states and territories to reduce the overrepresentation of First Nations children in detention. This includes:</p>Delivering a landmark National Justice Reinvestment Program,Investing $838 million in Aboriginal Legal Services through the new National Access to Justice Partnership,Working with states and territories through the Standing Council of Attorneys-General on the justice targets under Closing the Gap, andProviding $13.5 million for the U25-GO grant program and $28.3 million for the Youth Empowerment Program to deliver crime prevention, drug diversion, and jobs and skills programs for all youth under the age of 25 at risk of engaging with the criminal justice system.”<p>The Liberal National Coalition said: “We will continue to invest in measures to improve justice and community safety for Indigenous Australians. The former Coalition Government invested $274.5 million from 2021-22 in a number of initiatives including:</p>Intensive case management services to support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in youth detention or prison to transition successfully back into their communities and avoid reoffending,Community Night Patrols, which employ Indigenous people to patrol their local communities and offer culturally sensitive assistance and transportation to a safe place for those at risk of harm, andCustody Notification Services, which ensure that every Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander person who is taken into police custody receives a culturally appropriate health and wellbeing check and basic legal information.”<p>The Australian Greens said “The criminal justice system in Australia is a system of entrenched racism where First Nations people are more likely to be stopped by police, more likely to be searched, more likely to be charged and more likely to face serious penalties than their non First Nations counterparts. This has contributed to an epidemic of overrepresentation of First Nations people in prisons in every jurisdiction in Australia. To address this injustice, the Greens will provide $100 million over the forward estimates to implement all the recommendations from the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, in partnership with First Nations people, particularly the families left behind after a death in custody. We will also implement the recommendations from the Australian Law Reform Commission’s Pathway to Justice report on how to end the over-imprisonment of First Nations people, including by establishing a justice reinvestment coordinating body. We will work with affected communities to ensure the recommendations from the Royal Commission into the Detention and Protection of Children in the Northern Territory are also implemented.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Economic Rights</p>Research from the Australian Council of Social Services (ACOSS) has found that current social security payments are inadequate to cover the costs of food, housing, and transport in Australia. What is your position on the rate of social security payments? Are they adequate to ensure they meet Australia’s international human rights commitments?<p>The Australia Labor Party&nbsp;said “The Albanese Labor Government is committed to a strong and sustainable social safety net that provides support to those most in need, when they need it. Labor has made significant investments to strengthen the safety net, providing an additional $11.5 billion for social security payments. This includes delivering a $40 per fortnight increase to working age and student payments, including JobSeeker. In recognition that some people can face additional barriers to finding employment and need more support, we also expanded eligibility for the higher rate of Jobseeker to Australians aged 55 and over who are on payment for nine months or more, and to those with an assessed partial capacity to work of 0‑14 hours per week.</p><p>Since Labor was elected, the base rate of JobSeeker for single recipients with no dependent children has increased by 22 per cent, which is an extra $3,600 in additional support in people’s pockets each year.&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone who receives JobSeeker is eligible for at least one additional supplementary payment which could include the Energy Supplement, Family Tax Benefit and/or Commonwealth Rent Assistance. We’ve delivered the first back-to-back increases to Commonwealth Rent Assistance in over 30 years, to help people on income support, pensioners and low-income families to manage rental pressures. Combined with indexation, this means maximum rates of rent assistance have increased by 45 per cent since Labor was elected.</p><p>In addition, for single parents who face the difficult challenge of balancing work and care on their own, the Government has expanded eligibility for Parenting Payment Single until their youngest child turns 14, up from eight.&nbsp;</p><p>These measures have been complemented by the comprehensive cost of living relief delivered by Labor to ease pressure on households. This includes a tax cut for every taxpayer, two rounds of relief to help households with their energy bills, cheaper medicines on the PBS, freezing social security deeming rates and record investments to strengthen Medicare to make it cheaper to see a GP and establish more Urgent Care clinics.</p><p>Labor will always do what we can to provide support to people who need it. We’ve said we’ll look at payment rates as part of every Budget, and we’ll continue to do that.”</p><p>The Liberal National Coalition said “The Coalition believes that it is the government’s role to manage the budget in a prudent and responsible way, to alleviate household cost pressures and restore our standard of living so Australians can get ahead in life. We believe that a strong economy is the key to helping Australians fulfil their aspirations and ensure they can cover the basics in the household budget.</p><p>That is why the Coalition's key focus is creating jobs and getting people back into work, because we know that getting a job is the best way to improve the living standards of people and their families.&nbsp;</p><p>During the height of the pandemic, when Australians needed it most, the Coalition provided $32 billion in emergency support payments and delivered the largest increase to unemployment benefits for over 30 years. During that period, JobSeeker payment expenditure almost tripled, rising from $9.7 billion in 2018-19 to $27.4 billion in 2020-21.</p><p>There are few countries that provide the strong safety net available to Australians. JobSeeker payments are a non-contributory taxpayer funded payment that provides a safety net for people while they look for a job. It is not meant to be a salary or wage replacement. Every dollar spent is a dollar that someone earned, so it is incumbent upon us that spending on our social security safety net is sustainable into the future. Social security payment rates, including JobSeeker, Youth Allowance, Parenting Payment and related working-aged welfare payments, are indexed on a regular basis, which helps to maintain their value over time. Increases to these payment rates are automatically linked to specific price changes, such as the Consumer Price Index and wages.</p><p>In addition to base rates of payment, there are more than 20 supplementary payments available to income support recipients, depending on their circumstances and additional needs.</p><p>On top of direct payments, our social security system also includes employment services, Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme concessions and health care cards. All of this is funded by taxpayers and therefore needs to be managed responsibly. This responsibility extends to future generations who will have to meet the cost of the social security system in the decades to come.</p><p>An elected Dutton Coalition Government will ensure the welfare system is fit for purpose and provides a safety net for those Australians most in need.”</p><p>The Australian Greens said “It is clear the rate of social security payments in this country are woefully inadequate and do not meet Australia’s human rights commitments. The increase in income support payments during COVID temporarily lifted hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty, and kept many more from falling into poverty. In a wealthy country like ours, everyone should be able to afford the basics. The Greens have long called for and support income support payments to be lifted above the poverty line.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p>The Australian Homelessness Monitor has reported a 22 percent increase of the number of people rough sleeping in the three years to 2023-2024. What is your plan to ensure all Australians’ right to housing is protected and there is adequate availability of public housing?<p>The Australian Labor Party said “Labor is committed to ensuring all Australians have secure and affordable housing.</p><p>We’re delivering 55,000 social and affordable homes, with 28,000 in the construction and planning stages. Through initiatives such as the Housing Australia Future Fund, Labor is helping reduce homelessness and taking pressure off renters.</p><p>We’re investing $1.2 billion – nearly 20 times the Coalition over their entire decade in government to support women, children and young people fleeing domestic violence as well as older women at risk of homelessness. These investments are about ensuring that every Australian has the dignity and security of a safe place to call home.</p><p>Our Government is providing $9.3 billion over the next five years under the National Agreement on Social Housing and Homelessness (NASHH) with $400 million each year for homelessness services, which the States are required to match.</p><p>While many of these homes are being built, we are also providing real relief to renters doing it tough right now, with a 45% increase to Commonwealth Rent Assistance for around 1 million households.</p><p>There’s more work to do, but the foundations are in place and are making a huge difference for Australians that are doing it most tough.”</p><p>The Liberal National Coalition said “A Dutton Coalition Government will act immediately to fix the housing crisis by boosting the supply of new homes across Australia.</p><p>We will deliver $5 billion to fund essential infrastructure like water, power and sewerage at housing development sites to unlock up to 500,000 new homes, with 30 per cent invested in regional communities.</p><p>We will reduce migration to sensible levels that our housing supply can handle, as well as implement a two-year ban on foreign investors and temporary residents purchasing existing Australian homes.</p><p>The Coalition recognises the challenge of housing for the vulnerable. That's why we established the Affordable Housing Bond Aggregator to provide low-cost finance to registered community housing providers to deliver more social and affordable dwellings. A great achievement of the last Coalition Government was the Home Guarantee Scheme, which has helped over 200,000 Australians purchase their first home.</p><p>We expanded this Scheme to single parent families in recognition of the challenges they face, as saving for a deposit is even harder when you are on a single income with children. We also recognise that older women are increasingly at risk of homelessness and housing stress due to lower lifetime incomes, relationship breakdown, and the consequences of family and domestic violence. That's why the Coalition has announced it will extend its new Super Home Buyer Scheme, allowing separated women to access part of their superannuation to put towards a deposit on their own home to help rebuild their lives.”</p><p>The Australian Greens said “Australia is experiencing a rental and cost of living crisis. Decades of profit-driven policies have left too many people with skyrocketing rents, substandard housing, and long-term homelessness. The Greens are fighting for transformative solutions that put people first—building and renting homes at prices people can actually afford and making housing a right, not a privilege.</p><p>Our plan includes:</p>A new public property developer to rent and sell homes below market prices, delivering 610,000 new affordable homes in the next decade,Adopting the Housing First model in Australia with $5.2 billion over the first four years for 50,000 ongoing Housing First supportive tenancies nationwide and 40 new supportive accommodation buildings,Double federal funding to states and territories for homelessness services and public and community housing,Make unlimited rent increases illegal, by freezing rents for two years then capping rent increases long term at 2% every 2 years, saving renters thousands each year, andScrap negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount for investors who own more than one property.”<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Refugees and Asylum-seekers’ Rights</p>In January 2025, the UN Human Rights Committee found that Australia is responsible for arbitrary detention of asylum seekers in offshore facilities. What is your position on the offshore processing of asylum seekers?<p>The Australian Labor Party said “The Albanese Labor Government remains completely committed to Operation Sovereign Borders (OSB), of which offshore regional processing is an essential part. There has not been a successful people smuggling venture to Australia in more than a decade. This is due to the policies that underpin OSB and the work of our agencies to enforce them.</p><p>The message that you will never settle in Australia if you attempt to travel irregularly by boat is one of the best tools we have available to prevent people being exploited by people smugglers, and making an expensive, dangerous and futile journey towards Australia.</p><p>The Albanese Labor Government is committed to upholding Australia’s obligations under the Refugee Convention 1951 and other international human rights treaties to which Australia is a party.</p><p>Regional processing countries are responsible for determining how they manage people while their claims are being assessed, including whether they should be in detention.”</p><p>The Australian Greens said “Offshore detention is an enormously cruel policy designed to deter and punish people who are seeking a better life in Australia. Nauru and Manus Island have long been places of misery and death, which is a stain on Australia’s national conscience. Prolonged detention - both on and offshore - has a profound effect on a person’s mental health that can lead to self-harm and suicide. Australia should never have started this practice. The Greens will end offshore detention, bringing all persons still in Papua New Guinea or Nauru to Australia and into supported and supervised community accommodation, with the option of permanent settlement.”</p><p>The Liberal National Coalition did not respond to this question.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>The government has currently set its resettlement places under the Refugee and Humanitarian Program to 20,000 individuals for 2024-2025. Would you increase or decrease this number and to what level?<p>The Australian Labor Party said “Australia has a long and proud history of providing resettlement for refugees and others who are displaced as a result of conflict, persecution and human rights abuses. With more people displaced worldwide than ever before, we are stepping up to play our part in the global resettlement effort in a responsible way.</p><p>The Albanese Labor Government increased the number of places in Australia’s humanitarian program from 13,750 to 20,000 places in 2023-24, and maintained this number of places for the 2024-25 program. In contrast, Peter Dutton and the Liberal Party have committed to cutting the humanitarian program back to 13,750 places if they are elected.</p><p>Additionally, more than 20,000 Resolution of Status visas have been issued to former Temporary Protection visa/Safe Haven Enterprise visa holders since the pathway opened in February 2023. People on TPVs/SHEVs arrived before Operation Sovereign Borders, and had been living in limbo in Australia for more than a decade.</p><p>These actions demonstrate that by maintaining secure borders, we can deliver a generous, orderly and compassionate humanitarian program while preventing people smuggling and loss of life at sea and without compromising Operation Sovereign Borders.”</p><p>The Liberal National Coalition said “Australia is the greatest multicultural nation in the world, something all Australians should be proud of. Since World War II, Australia has resettled more than 950,000 refugees and others with a humanitarian need. A Dutton Coalition Government will reduce the Refugee and Humanitarian intake to its long-term average of 13,750 per year, ensuring Australia remains one of the most generous humanitarian resettlement countries in the world and can respond flexibly to humanitarian crises overseas. We will continue to provide essential support to refugee and humanitarian entrants settling in Australia, in partnership with community organisations, trained volunteers and faith- based groups.”</p><p>The Australian Greens said “The Greens will increase Australia’s humanitarian intake from 20,000 to 50,000 per year.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p>Australia is one of the world’s biggest exporters of coal and gas. Given the climate crisis, what is your position on phasing out fossil fuels and if you support phasing out fossil fuels, what would your plan be to achieve this?<p>The Australian Labor Party said “At COP28, Labor was proud to advocate for and secure an agreement committing to transition away from fossil fuels in energy systems, to tripling global renewable energy capacity, and doubling the rate of energy efficiency improvements by 2030.</p><p>At COP29, Labor joined 25 countries and the EU in committing to not building new coal power plants. The pledge stands in stark contrast to the Liberal party, who funded a noncompetitive $3.3 million feasibility study into a new coal power plant at Collinsville, which was slammed by the ANAO.</p><p>We have expanded the Capacity Investment Scheme to unlock new investment and deliver 32 GW of reliable, affordable renewable electricity to all Australians by 2030. We are backing offshore wind, rooftop solar, batteries and other technologies that the Coalition would stop under their nuclear scheme.”</p><p>The Liberal National Coalition said “Our approach is to reduce emissions through technology, not taxes, and in ways that don’t risk regional jobs.</p><p>As a general principle, the Coalition acknowledges Australia’s resources sector has been integral to our economy. It accounts for around 12 per cent of Australia’s GDP and more than 60 per cent of Australia’s exports. It directly employs more than 280,000 people and indirectly supports the jobs of some 1.1 million Australians, as well as many communities and businesses across regional Australia.</p><p>Resource industry export earnings were $417 billion in 2023-24, helping to support the living standards of all Australians. Taxes and royalties from the industry are providing vital revenues to fund roads, hospitals, schools and other essential services we all rely on.”</p><p>The Australian Greens said “The phase out of fossil fuels is the number one task to stop our planet cooking and Australia has an oversized responsibility to contribute because of how much pollution we export to the world. The Greens’ climate targets are for a 75% reduction on 2005 levels by 2030 and for net-zero emissions by 2035, which is what maintaining warming to 1.5 degrees requires.</p><p>We have a comprehensive plan to phase out fossil fuels, including:</p>No new coal, oil and gas project approvals,End subsidies to coal, oil and gas corporations including fossil fuel subsidies in the Budget,Make gas exporters pay taxes and royalties,Planned coal station closure framework,Transition plans for coal and gas workers, and<p>Investment in clean energy industries of the future to replace fossil fuels.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Justice and Accountability</p>Do you support Australia being a member of the International Criminal Court (ICC)? Should Australia enforce ICC arrest warrants for active heads of state?<p>The Australian Labor Party said “Australia has been a longstanding supporter of the International Criminal Court (ICC). Under the Albanese Labor Government, that position has not changed. We continue to reiterate our respect for the Court, its independence and its important role in upholding international law. Australia will act consistently with its international obligations. The Albanese Labor Government’s approach will be informed by international law, not politics. We are not contemplating and would not contemplate withdrawing from the ICC.”</p><p>The Liberal National Coalition said “Australia signed the Rome Statue establishing the International Criminal Court in 1998 under the Howard Coalition Government to enhance international peace and security. The Coalition is committed to universal human rights, including the rule of law, individual freedom and the right to dignity and respect.”</p><p>The Australian Greens said “The Greens support Australia remaining a member of the International Criminal Court. As signatories to the Rome Statute, Australia has an obligation to enforce all ICC arrest warrants including those for active heads of state and the Greens believe that Australia should uphold that obligation.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p>In 2024, the Australian government used its thematic human rights or corruption sanctions on entities or individuals in Iran, Russia, and Israel. Other sanctions were also placed individuals and entities in Myanmar and affiliates of Hamas in Palestine. Should Australia impose targeted sanctions against Chinese officials or companies for severe human rights abuses, including crimes against humanity against Uyghurs?<p>The Australian Labor Party said “The Albanese Labor Government’s support for human rights and values is central to who we are and how we seek to shape the world. We deploy every strategy at our disposal towards upholding human rights – ranging from dialogue and diplomacy to sanctions – consistent with our values and our interests. Sanctions are an essential foreign policy tool. But they are not the only way – nor necessarily the most effective way – to push for change.</p><p>The Albanese Labor Government takes every opportunity to convey our concerns to China about human rights situations, including in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong. Our resumption of dialogue with China has enabled us to consistently raise our deep concerns at the highest levels, as Prime Minister Albanese and Foreign Minister Wong have done.</p><p>We also raise our concerns publicly, and partner with other countries to advocate and build coalitions for the protection of human rights. In October 2024, Australia led, for the first time, a joint statement at the Human Rights Council with 14 partners, drawing on the credible and objective findings of independent United Nations experts about the human rights situation in China. Assistant Minister for Foreign Affairs Tim Watts also raised China’s human rights violations against Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang in Australia’s high-level statement to the 58th session of the Human Rights Council on 27 February.</p><p>Unlike predecessors, the Foreign Minister has regularly engaged with Hong Kong, Uyghur and Tibetan communities in Australia, as well as the advocates from civil society organisations and across the parliament. We are committed to having their voices heard in bilateral and multilateral forums.”</p><p>The Liberal National Coalition said “We have consistently voiced our concerns about human rights violations, including in Tibet, Xinjiang and Hong Kong. Under the former Coalition Government, Australia was one of 45 countries to join a statement on human rights in China at the UN Human Rights Council. Australian officials regularly raised our concerns about the treatment of Tibetans with Chinese officials in Canberra and Beijing, particularly the detention of Tibetans for the peaceful expression of political views, restrictions on travel and China’s policies on Tibetan cultural rights and heritage.</p><p>The Coalition has repeatedly called on the Labor Government to use the Magnitsky-style sanctions at their disposal to respond to human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang region.</p><p>We strongly supported the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights’ calls for the prompt release of all individuals arbitrarily deprived of their liberty and an urgent independent investigation into allegations of human rights abuse.&nbsp;<br />We are disappointed that the Labor government has not taken up our offer of bipartisanship.”</p><p>The Australian Greens said “The Greens have consistently called for application of targeted sanctions on Chinese oﬃcials or companies responsible for severe human rights abuses, including those committed against Uyghurs or Tibetans.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p>A few dozen Australian nationals, including women and children, remain detained in camps and prisons in Northeast Syria as Islamic State (ISIS) suspects or their family members. What response do you intend to take to address this situation and what is your position on creating a pathway for their return and rehabilitation or as appropriate criminal investigations?<p>The Australian Labor Party said “Decisions relating to repatriations of Australia-linked women and children located in internally displace persons (IDP) camps in northeast Syria are made on the basis of a range of security, diplomatic, community and welfare factors. The government’s overriding priority is the protection of Australians and Australia’s national interest, informed by national security advice.</p><p>The government acknowledges the humanitarian and welfare issues affecting those in IDP camps. We are partnering with international humanitarian organisations who have access to the camps and the mandate and expertise to deliver assistance. Australia has provided more than half a billion dollars to the Syrian regional response since 2011, including a further $30 million to address urgent humanitarian needs announced in March this year.”</p><p>The Australian Greens said “The Greens are supportive of creating a pathway for the return of Australian nationals currently imprisoned in prison camps in North East Syria, as well as rehabilitation of these individuals following a human-rights compliant process to ensure they are innocent of any criminal activity. We are proud to have campaigned alongside HRW and many other organisations on this issue - particularly in relation to children.”</p><p>The Liberal National Coalition did not respond to this question.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>Throughout the Asia-Pacific region, governments from Vietnam to India have suppressed human rights defenders, journalists, and bloggers. What steps should Australia take to promote the rights to freedom of expression, media freedom, and freedom of association throughout the region?<p>The Australian Labor Party said “The Albanese Labor Government is committed to protecting, promoting and advancing universal human rights, including to advocate for media freedom and the protection of journalists and human rights defenders.

Two unlawful Israeli strikes on the northeastern Lebanese town of Younine between September and November 2024 were apparent indiscriminate attacks on civilians.More and more evidence is emerging that Israeli forces repeatedly failed to protect civilians or adequately distinguish civilians from military targets during its strikes across Lebanon in 2023 and 2024.Lebanon’s government should provide a path for justice for grieving families, including by giving the International Criminal Court jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute crimes. All countries – including the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany – should suspend military assistance and arms sales to Israel.<p>(Beirut) – Two unlawful Israeli strikes on the northeastern Lebanese town of Younine between September and November 2024, which killed 33 civilians, 15 of them children, were apparent indiscriminate attacks on civilians, Human Rights Watch said today.</p><p>At least one of the attacks used an air-dropped bomb equipped with a&nbsp;United States-produced Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) guidance kit. The attacks should be investigated as war crimes.</p><p>“More and more evidence is emerging that Israeli forces repeatedly failed to protect civilians or adequately distinguish civilians from military targets during its strikes across Lebanon in 2023 and 2024,” said Ramzi Kaiss, Lebanon researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Lebanon’s government should provide a path for justice for grieving families, including by giving the International Criminal Court jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute crimes.”</p><p>In May 2024, Lebanon’s former government reversed a decision which it had issued a month earlier to give the International Criminal Court (ICC) jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute serious crimes committed on Lebanese territory since October 7, 2023. Lebanon’s new government should urgently accept ICC jurisdiction to give the court’s prosecutor a mandate to investigate serious international crimes committed on the country’s territory.</p><p>One attack, on September 25, killed a family of 23 people, all Syrians, including 13 children. On November 1, a strike on a two-story house killed 10 people, including 2 children, one of them a year old, 5 women, and 3 men. Human Rights Watch did not find any evidence of military activity or targets at either site.</p><p>Human Rights Watch investigated a third strike in Younine that occurred on November 21, which killed a family of four adults.Researchers found several Hezbollah “martyr” posters online and in Younine for one of the male victims, but were unable to verify who made the posters, and reviewed photos of his grave indicating that he may have been a Hezbollah combatant.</p><p>Between November 2024 and February 2025, Human Rights Watch researchers visited the sites of the two strikes in Younine, near Baalbeck, in eastern Lebanon. Human Rights Watch researchers also visited the cemetery in Younine and inspected the burial sites of people from the village killed in Israeli attacks, including combatants and civilians. Human Rights Watch reviewed photos and videos shared on social media in the aftermath of the strikes.</p><p>Human Rights Watch interviewed 10 people, some in person, at strike sites in Younine, and others via telephone. Weapon remnants found at the sites of the September 25 and November 21 strikes and reviewed by Human Rights Watch arms researchers indicate the Israeli military’s use of a Mk-80 series general purpose air-dropped bomb equipped with a US-made JDAM kit. Weapon remnants found at the site of the November 1 strike also indicate the Israeli military’s use of a Mk-80 series general purpose bomb.</p><p>The Israeli military did not warn civilians to evacuate before either strike, residents told Human Rights Watch. Human Rights Watch verified this claim by reviewing social media posts by the Israeli Arabic language spokesperson and the Israeli military’s Arabic language telegram channels, where evacuation warnings are typically shared. Human Rights Watch sent a letter outlining its findings and posing questions to the Israeli military on March 24 but has not received a response.</p><p>Under international humanitarian law, all parties to the conflict are obligated, at all times, to distinguish between combatants and civilians and to direct attacks only against combatants or other military objectives. Individuals who commit serious violations of the laws of war with criminal intent – that is, intentionally or recklessly – may be prosecuted for war crimes. Individuals may also be held criminally liable for assisting in, facilitating, aiding, or abetting a war crime. All governments that are parties to an armed conflict are obligated to investigate alleged war crimes by members of their armed forces.</p><p>When carrying out any attack, warring parties must take all feasible precautions to minimize civilian harm and damage to civilian objects. This includes taking all necessary actions to verify that targets are military objectives.</p><p>Between October 2023 and December 2024, Israeli attacks in&nbsp;Lebanon killed more than 4,000 people and displaced over one million. Since the November 27 ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah&nbsp;came into effect, Israeli attacks have&nbsp;reportedly killed at least 146 people in Lebanon, including at least 26 who were attempting to return to villages where Israeli forces had not yet withdrawn. As of March 20, nearly&nbsp;100,000 people remained displaced in the country from the recent conflict, according to the United Nations International Organization for Migration (IOM).</p><p>Lebanon and other United Nations member states should establish an international investigation into all human rights violations committed by all parties involved in the conflict in Lebanon. Such an investigation could document ongoing crimes, collect evidence, and publicly report on their findings. Lebanon’s government could also further its cooperation with the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and ongoing investigations into Israeli attacks in Lebanon to ensure accurate documentation of unlawful attacks, including war crimes committed between October 2023 and December 2024.</p><p>The United States government’s provision of arms to Israel, which have repeatedly been used to carry out apparent war crimes, has made the US complicit in their&nbsp;unlawful use. Human Rights Watch has previously documented the unlawful use of US weapons in and unlawful attack on aid workers and an apparently deliberate attack on journalists in Lebanon.</p><p>Providing military assistance to Israel violates US law, which prohibits arms transfers to “any country the government of which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations internationally recognized human rights.” All states, including Israel’s key allies such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany should suspend military assistance and arms sales to Israel.</p><p>Lebanon’s parliament should also ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>“Countries still supplying Israel with arms, including primarily the United States, need to wake up to the reality that their continued military support, despite ample evidence of unlawful attacks, has made them complicit in the unlawful killing of civilians,” Kaiss said. “Victims have a right to justice and reparations, and those responsible should be held to account.”</p>September 25 Israeli Airstrike<p>After 10 p.m. on September 25, an Israeli airstrike struck a residential building along the main Baalbek-Qaa highway near the road junction that leads into the center of the town of Younine, killing 22 members of one extended Syrian family, including 13 children. Another family member died eight days later in a Damascus hospital as a result of his injuries. Seven people survived the attack, including three Lebanese men, six of them with various injuries.</p>

<p>Human Rights Watch interviewed multiple sources about the incident, including four survivors, the building’s owner, who is also the mother of one survivor, a local supermarket owner who was among the first to arrive at the scene, the mayor of Younine, a relative of the family who lives in Idlib, Syria, and a Lebanese researcher familiar with the town.</p><p>Researchers verified photos and videos of the immediate aftermath, the burial of the victims two days later, and satellite imagery. They cross-referenced a list of casualties provided by the family’s relative in Idlib with Younine’s mayor and two survivors. Researchers conducted open-source research into the names of both victims and survivors, to establish if any of them may have been or are combatants, and cross-referenced findings with open-source material shared by Airwars, a nongovernmental organization that investigates civilian harm in conflict zones. During a December 2 visit to the site, researchers viewed remnants of a bomb equipped with a United States-produced JDAM guidance kit found in the rubble.</p><p>Witnesses said that the two-story building contained two apartments on the ground floor, both rented to Syrians. The family living in the other ground floor apartment was not present at the time of the attack. Two other buildings sharing the same owner are attached to the building, one of which housed the three other branches of the Abdelkader family, and another that housed the owner and five of her other children, who had fled the building soon after Israel intensified its aerial campaign on Lebanon in September 2024. The buildings also housed a physical therapy center, a mobile phone shop, and a shuttered gas station that had been out of operation for over a year.</p>

<p>“My uncle’s family who lived in that building, they were planning to leave to Syria the next morning so we were all gathered there to say goodbye,” said Yousef Abdelkader, 16, who alongside his brother Mohammad, 17, and their cousin, 15-year-old Hassan, were the only survivors from the Abdelkader family in the building at the time of the attack. The attack killed their parents, siblings, grandfather, and two uncles’ families.</p><p>“Just before the strike, I left the apartment ahead of the rest of my family to return to my family’s apartment in one of the attached buildings. My mom, grandpa, and others were still standing just outside the door talking to the rest of the family when I heard the sound of a plane, and I saw the rocket fall,” said Yousef.&nbsp;</p><p>Other survivors were a distant relative who also lived in Younine, the building owner’s son, who lived on the second floor, and two Lebanese neighbors. Waleed Rbeidi, the relative, said: “[When the bomb struck], I was on the ground-floor veranda with some other men from the neighborhood, friends of mine, who had called over to me to have coffee with them.”</p><p>Rbeidi and another survivor both said that they received no warning ahead of the attack. “We just heard the sound of the rocket and suddenly the house fell over their heads,” he said, telling researchers that doctors had to later remove several pieces of shrapnel from his body.</p><p>“There was no warning,” said the building owner’s son.&nbsp;“The munition came straight down on us. Each of us [standing in the veranda] flew in a different direction.”</p><p>Another Lebanese survivor, who lives on the same street and owns a shop nearby, described the moments leading up to the attack: “We were all staying up late together that night. For a couple of hours before the strike, I remember we didn’t hear any drones, it was quiet. All I remember from the strike is hearing a loud noise and then I lost consciousness. I spent 20 days in the hospital with shrapnel in my leg, arm, and neck.”</p><p>The Israeli military did not comment directly on the strike, but it posted on X and Telegram the next morning that its forces had struck approximately 75 Hezbollah targets in the Bekaa area and in southern Lebanon overnight, including “weapons storage facilities, ready-to-fire launchers, terrorists, and terrorist infrastructure.”</p><p>Younine’s mayor, Ali Kassas, said that two other airstrikes had targeted the town earlier that day. Human Rights Watch found no evidence of a military target in the immediate area of the September 25 strike and all those interviewed insisted there were no fighters or military equipment in the building or the neighborhood. “We are still trying to make sense of the strike, to find a reason for it,” Kassas said. “We still can’t understand why they would target a building full of Syrians. They’re not even Lebanese. The entire intersection is mostly Syrians, many […] camps around and most buildings rented to Syrians.”</p><p>Kassas described the rescue efforts: “We headed to the location immediately after we learned of the strike, ambulances too, and we pulled bodies from under the rubble. On the first day we pulled 19, we didn’t even know how many people were in the building to begin with or who they were. There was a boy who was a relative of some of the dead and he helped us identify them and said that there were others missing, including his uncle and aunt. The second day we went back and pulled out three more.”</p><p>“After the strike, dead bodies were strewn across the ground,” said Yousef, who helped rescuers identify his family members who were killed. “It was really hard for me to identify them because some of them were in pieces.”</p>November 1 Strike<p>At around 2 p.m. on November 1, an Israeli strike on the al-Salah neighborhood in Younine destroyed a two-story building.</p><p>Human Rights Watch researchers visited the site on December 2, 2024, and February 12, 2025, and interviewed Ali Salah, who lost 10 family members in the strike. Salah lived in the same neighborhood and was in the vicinity at the time of the attack. On February 12, Human Rights Watch also spoke to another neighbor and relative of the Salah family who lived in the same neighborhood and spoke with the mayor of Younine about the strike on March 21.</p>

<p>Ali Salah said that those killed in the strike included his two sisters, Wadha, born 1959, and Fairouz, born 1975; his brothers-in-law:, Haidar Mahdi Salah, who worked as a painter and owned a supermarket, and Mohammad Mahdi Salah, who worked as a taxi driver; his nieces, Elissar, 27, and Zeina, 17; his nephew Ali Haidar Salah, 30, and Ali’s family, including his wife, Nour Boudaq, his son, Haidar, a year old, and his mother-in-law, Um Bachir Boudaq.</p><p>“Haidar [Mahdi Salah] works as a painter, and Mohammed works as Taxi driver,” Ali Kassas, the mayor, told Human Rights Watch. “Ali Haidar works with his dad as a painter, and the rest were children and women. Haidar [Ali Salah] was just one year old […] None of the people killed were combatants. They’re not even connected to any party.”</p><p>The strike came shortly after Mohammed Mahdi Salah returned home after finishing his shift as a taxi driver, Ali Salah said.</p><p>“Mohammed makes about LBP50,000 [around US$0.55] for a ride in the Bekaa,” he said. “All our family, the Salah family, we don’t have a single person in Hezbollah. Not a single person. Ask whoever you want.”</p><p>“There’s no one I value more than my sisters. If I thought there was any reason for there to be a military target here, I would have forced them to leave. There was nothing here. Just civilians.”</p>

<p>The Israeli military did not comment directly about this strike. However, a post shared on the Israeli armed forces’ telegram page on November 2, one day after the strike, stated that “over the past day, the [Israeli Air Force] struck more than 120 terror targets belonging to both Hamas and Hezbollah. These included anti-tank missile launching sites, terrorist operatives, terror infrastructure sites, weapons storage facilities, and command centers in Lebanon.”</p><p>Human Rights Watch conducted open-source research on the strike, including into the names of those killed, to determine if they were combatants. Researchers did not find any evidence indicating the presence of combatants or a military objective at the site of the strike. All individuals interviewed said that no evacuation warning was given to residents prior to the strike.</p><p>A banner outside the cemetery in Younine, which Human Rights Watch researchers visited, displayed the names and photos of people from Younine who were killed in Israeli attacks, including civilians and individuals who appear to be combatants. Photos of the male victims of the November 1 attack – including Mohmmad Mahdi Salah, Haidar Mahdi Salah, and Ali Haidar Salah – showed them in civilian clothing and appear to be designated as civilians below the photographs of apparent combatants. The names of women killed in the strike were displayed without photos. None of the individuals killed in the November 1 attack were buried in an area within the cemetery that appeared to be reserved for Hezbollah fighters.</p><p>Ali Salih described his anguish over the death of his family members. “Um Bachir [Salih’s mother-in-law] wanted to go to Ghobeiry, in Dahyeh [Beirut’s southern suburb], and I would tell her, ‘If I tell you to leave and you get killed, I will feel very guilty; If you stay and get killed, I’ll also feel very guilty. So do as you want.’”</p><p>Kassas, the mayor, who arrived at the site of the strike shortly after the attack, described horrific scenes: “The scene at the strike made our hearts cry. Some bodies did not have heads attached to them. Other bodies were flattened by the strike. One person, we just knew them by their skin and beard […] We tried to resuscitate the child [Ali Haidar] when we pulled him out, but when we checked for a pulse, he was dead.”</p>

Title    : Thailand: Prime Minister Should Raise Cross-Border Abuses in Cambodia

<p>(Bangkok) – Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra should raise outstanding human rights concerns with Cambodian leaders during her visit to Phnom Penh on April 23-24, 2025, Human Rights Watch said today. Prime Minister Paetongtarn is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Hun Manet, Senate President Hun Sen, and King Norodom Sihamoni to mark the 75th anniversary of Thai-Cambodian diplomatic relations.</p><p>The Cambodian and Thai governments have engaged in transnational repression—government efforts to silence dissent by committing human rights abuses against their own nationals outside their own territory—through reciprocal arrangements targeting dissidents and opposition figures, colloquially known as a “swap mart.” Both governments have facilitated assaults, abductions, enforced disappearances, and the forced return of people to their home countries where their lives or freedom are at risk.</p><p>“Thailand shouldn’t sideline human rights as it seeks to expand its partnership with Cambodia,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Prime Minister Paetongtarn should press her Cambodian counterparts to end transnational abuses that discredit both countries globally and to put their relationship on a rights-respecting footing instead.”</p><p>Cambodian authorities have made no progress in arresting suspects responsible for killing Lim Kimya, a dual French-Cambodian national and former member of the Cambodian parliament from the now-dissolved opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), in Bangkok on January 7, 2025. The Bangkok Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for two Cambodian nationals, Ly Ratanakraksmey and Pich Kimsrin, who are both connected to high-ranking Cambodian government officials and remain at large.</p><p>After Kimya’s killing, many critics of the Cambodian government living abroad concluded that nowhere is safe. A number of those who had fled to Thailand have been targets of transnational repression, at times with the cooperation of Thai authorities, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>Thai authorities have frequently used immigration charges to justify the unlawful deportation of Cambodian dissidents and activists without any due process guarantees, including those recognized as refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). On November 25, 2024, Cambodian authorities detained Pen Chan Sangkream, Hong An, Mean Chanthon, Yin Chanthou, Soeung Khunthea, and Vorn Chanratchana after they were forcibly returned by Thai immigration officials. The six opposition party supporters were charged without basis with plotting to commit an attack under article 453 of Cambodia’s criminal code, which is punishable by up to 10 years in prison.</p><p>In 2021 Thailand forcibly returned two Cambodian refugees associated with the CNRP, subjecting them to politically motivated charges and persecution in Cambodia. One of them, Voeung Samnang, fled to Thailand in 2020 following the crackdown on the CNRP. In December 2024, Cambodian courts upheld a six-year prison sentence for Samnang under charges of plotting to commit an attack and incitement. The other, Veourn Veasna, was released in 2024 following an apology and temporary defection to the ruling Cambodian People’s Party. Both men had received refugee status from UNHCR.</p><p>Under the military rule of Gen. Prayut Chan-ocha, who took power in Thailand following a coup in May 2014, Thai authorities aggressively pursued exiled critics of the monarchy who had fled to Cambodia and subjected them to surveillance, intimidation, and physical attacks.</p><p>On June 4, 2020, armed men in Phnom Penh abducted the prominent pro-democracy activist, Wanchalearm Satsaksit. Cambodian authorities have failed to seriously and transparently investigate this case, while successive Thai governments have not pressed Cambodia for results. Prime Minister Paetongtarn has not responded to the National Human Rights Commission of Thailand’s report accusing Thai officials of involvement in Wanchalearm’s enforced disappearance.</p><p>“Bangkok and Phnom Penh need to immediately end transnational persecution of critics and political opposition figures,” Pearson said. “Prime Minister Paetongtarn should use her visit to Phnom Penh to begin a new chapter of partnership that is based on respect for human rights.”</p>

<p>(Jakarta) – Recent threats and attacks on journalists and news outlets in&nbsp;Indonesia are having a chilling effect on the country’s media, Human Rights Watch said today. The Indonesian government under President Prabowo Subianto Djojohadikusumo should urgently act to protect media freedom, including by taking action against officials who make unsubstantiated public allegations against journalists that undermine the right to freedom of expression.</p><p>Journalists were beaten while covering protests, physically attacked by unidentified assailants, and threatened at their workplace, including with&nbsp;animal carcasses. Many of the recent attacks appear to be reprisals for criticism by the media of&nbsp;amendments to the armed forces law that significantly expand the military’s role in governance and weaken legal checks on abusive officials. Senior government officials have also dangerously alleged without basis that journalists and media outlets “promote foreign interest.”</p><p>“President Prabowo should recognize that further attacks on journalists and media figures will undercut press freedoms crucial to the government’s plans for economic growth and social justice in Indonesia,” said&nbsp;Meenakshi Ganguly, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch.&nbsp;“The government should ensure that Indonesians are able to freely express their views without fear of retaliation, and that independent media can create an environment for open discussion without harassment or intimidation.”</p><p>The media outlet Tempo, which has&nbsp;a long history of public criticism in Indonesia has been especially targeted, apparently because of its critical coverage of the Prabowo administration. On March 20, 2025, Francisca Christy Rosana, a Christian journalist at Tempo who hosts its popular podcast “Bocor Alus Politik” (fine political leaks), received a package&nbsp;containing a pig’s head without its ears, menacingly symbolic in a Muslim-majority nation. She was doxed (her personal information was posted with malicious intent), her mother’s phone was hacked, and a relative received threatening anonymous phone calls.</p><p>On March 22, cleaners at Tempo’s office in Jakarta found a&nbsp;box of six rats with their heads cut off. This appeared to be an&nbsp;act of intimidation against the podcast’s six hosts, who discuss sensitive political issues and have criticized the Prabowo administration.</p><p>Several journalists have since installed CCTVs and dashboard cameras to identify any assailants. “If the intention is to scare,”&nbsp;said Tempo’s editor-in-chief, Setri Yasra, “we are not deterred.”</p><p>On March 24, the police forced two journalists to delete photos and videos from their phones, after the authorities cracked down on a&nbsp;protest in Surabaya against the military law amendments.&nbsp;Rama Indra, a journalist with the local digital outlet Berita Jatim, said that police officers forced him to stop filming as they were beating protesters, and also hit him in the head. The police forced Wildan Pratama, a journalist with the local radio station Suara Surabaya, to&nbsp;delete his photos of arrested protesters. Reporters Without Borders&nbsp;reported that the police and unidentified assailants attacked at least 14 journalists and journalism students who were covering similar protests across the country.</p><p>These recent attacks are part of a growing pattern of abuse against the media, Human Rights Watch said. Unidentified men twice&nbsp;smashed the windshield of the podcast host, Hussein Abri Dongoran, in Jakarta, on August 4, 2024, and then again on September 3. Both times his dashboard cameras recorded two men on a single motorcycle throwing a carburetor into the windshield. Tempo reported the cases to the Jakarta police but with no significant result.</p><p>Military personnel have also been implicated in attacks on journalists, Human Rights Watch said. In Jayapura, Papua, on October 16, 2024, two men on a motorcycle threw a gasoline bomb at the newsroom of Jubi news media, an independent newspaper, burning two cars. Staff and bystanders eventually extinguished the fire. The Papua police produced a report on January 22, 2025, based on interviews with nine witnesses and CCTV recordings,&nbsp;implicating two Indonesian soldiers in the attack. The Papua police handed over the report to the Indonesian military police in Jayapura for prosecution. But the military returned the report to the police in February, saying that there was insufficient evidence to proceed.</p><p>In Kabanjahe, North Sumatra, Rico Sempurna Pasaribu, a reporter with the Medan-based Tribata TV, and three family members, his wife, daughter, and 3-year-old grandson,&nbsp;were found dead inside their small wooden house on June 27, 2024. Police arrested three men. Bebas Ginting, the primary suspect,&nbsp;admitted to the attack during trial, saying that he was ordered “to secure the media” because of Pasaribu’s reporting on illegal online gambling. The order, he said, had come from an army sergeant.</p><p>On March 27, 2025, the Kabanjahe court&nbsp;sentenced Ginting and one of the others to life in prison and the other to 20 years. No action has been taken thus far against the sergeant who allegedly ordered the attack. Indonesia’s Press Council has&nbsp;called on the military to follow up on Ginting’s testimony that he was acting on behalf of the military personnel.</p><p>In February, the National Police&nbsp;issued a regulation requiring foreign journalists and researchers to obtain police permits to work in “certain locations” without clarifying what or where they are. The regulation, which took effect on March 10,&nbsp;grants police the authority to issue certificates so that they can “provide services and protection” to foreign journalists, especially in conflict-prone areas, the National Police spokesman said.</p><p>Human Rights Watch has previously&nbsp;documented the lengthy bureaucratic process, involving 18 state institutions, before foreign journalists can work in Indonesia, assuming their visas are approved in the so-called clearing house at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. West Papua’s six provinces are routinely excluded from approval.</p><p>The media have also been subjected to digital attacks. Indonesia’s Journalist Safety Committee&nbsp;recorded multiple digital attacks against media companies, including more than a billion DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks against Tempo’s website in April 2025, crippling services for several hours. Other news outlets included&nbsp;Konde, Project Multatuli, and Narasi TV. Several journalists told Human Rights Watch that they had become more cautious in their reporting because of these frequent attacks.</p><p>“The Prabowo administration could make a stronger case for Indonesia being a rights-respecting democracy by seriously investigating alleged threats and attacks against the media,” Ganguly said. “The authorities should also withdraw unnecessary restrictions, including travel permit requirements, on foreign journalists and let them do their jobs.”</p>

<p>(Beirut) –&nbsp;A&nbsp;Tunisian court on April 19, 2025,&nbsp;sentenced 37 defendants to between 4 and 66 years in prison in the politically motivated “Conspiracy Case,” Human Rights Watch said today. The Tunis Court of First Instance issued the sentences after just three sessions in the mass trial, without providing the defendants with an adequate opportunity to present their defenses and without other due process protections.</p><p>On May 2, 2024, a Tunis prosecutor&nbsp;alleged that lawyers, political opponents, activists, researchers, and businessmen were plotting to overthrow President Kais Saied by destabilizing the country, and even of plotting to assassinate him. Forty defendants were charged and referred for trial under numerous articles of Tunisia’s Penal Code and 2015 Counterterrorism Law, including some that carry the death penalty. The court&nbsp;began the trial on March 4. Sentences were handed down against 37 defendants, while the remaining three have complaints pending with the Court of Cassation.</p><p>“The Tunisian court did not give defendants so much as a semblance of a fair trial, sentencing them to long terms after a mass trial in which they could not adequately present their case,” said&nbsp;Bassam Khawaja, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “The Tunisian authorities are making it clear that anyone participating in political opposition or civic activism risks years in prison after a hasty trial without due process.”</p><p>According to the judgment, which Human Rights Watch reviewed, the court&nbsp;sentenced the former justice minister and senior Ennahda opposition party leader Noureddine Bhiri to 43 years in prison; the businessman Kamel Ltaief to 66 years; and the opposition politician Khayam Turki to 48 years. Prominent opposition figures Ghazi Chaouachi, Issam Chebbi, Jaouhar Ben Mbarek, Ridha Belhaj, and Chaima Issa were each sentenced to 18 years. Abdelhamid Jelassi, a political activist and former Ennahda party member, and Said Ferjani, a former Ennahda parliament member, were sentenced to 13 years; and Lazhar Akremi, a lawyer and former minister, was sentenced to 8 years. The court sentenced another 15 defendants, including the exiled feminist activist Bochra Belhaj Hamida, to 28 years in prison.</p><p>Most defendants are not in custody, and some are outside the country and were tried in absentia. At least 12 were arrested in February 2023, and 8 remained in detention as of January 2025. Some of the defendants had been in abusive pretrial&nbsp;detention for more than two years, beyond the maximum permitted under Tunisian law.</p><p>Tunisian authorities have taken additional steps in this case to undermine the right to a fair trial. On February 26, ahead of the first session, the trial court’s president and its prosecutor ordered the detained defendants to&nbsp;appear by videoconference, claiming a “real danger.” Trial by video is inherently abusive as it undermines detainees’ right to be brought physically before a judge to assess their well-being and the legality and conditions of their detention.</p><p>In subsequent sessions, the court barred journalists and trial observers, including Human Rights Watch, from entering the courtroom. One defendant, Chaima Issa, was not permitted to enter the courtroom to attend her own trial for the April 11 session.</p><p>On April 21, agents of the antiterrorist unit of the National Guard&nbsp;arrested a lawyer in the case, Ahmed Souab, in his home, after he issued statements to the media about the verdict. He was placed in custody under the 2015 counterterrorism law and is&nbsp;accused of “terrorist and common law offenses,” including “threatening to commit terrorist acts with the aim of compelling a person to do or refrain from doing an act and exposing a protected person’s life to danger.”</p><p>Other defense lawyers in Tunisia have been&nbsp;subjected to increasing judicial harassment and criminal prosecution for the legitimate exercise of their profession. Ayachi Hammami, previously a defense lawyer in the case, was added as a defendant in&nbsp;May 2023, and was sentenced to eight years in prison.</p><p>The Tunisian government has been using arbitrary detention and politically motivated prosecutions to intimidate, punish, and silence critics, Human Rights Watch said. Following President Saied’s&nbsp;takeover of Tunisia’s state institutions on July 25, 2021, the authorities have dramatically intensified their repression of dissent. Since early 2023, they have&nbsp;stepped up arbitrary arrests and detention of people across the political spectrum who were perceived as critical of the government. The authorities’ repeated&nbsp;attacks on the judiciary, including Saied’s dismantling of the High Judicial Council, have severely undermined its independence and jeopardized Tunisians’ right to a fair trial.</p><p>Tunisia is a state party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, which guarantee the right to freedom of expression and assembly, to a fair trial, and to not be subject to arbitrary arrest or detention.</p><p>Tunisian authorities should overturn these convictions, guarantee fair trials, and stop prosecuting individuals for exercising their human rights, Human Rights Watch said. Tunisia’s international partners should break their silence and urge the government to end its crackdown and to protect space for freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly.</p><p>“The sham ‘Conspiracy Case’ trial reflects the depths to which President Kais Saied’s government will go to eliminate the last vestiges of political opposition and free speech in the country,” Khawaja said. “Concerned governments need to speak out or Tunisian authorities will continue to pursue manufactured and abusive prosecutions while failing to address the country’s economic crises.”</p>

Title    : Texas Bill Would Criminalize Those Transporting Youth for Abortion Care
Published: Tue, 22 Apr 2025 08:00:00 -0400
Summary  :
<p>A harmful bill in the Texas legislature would criminalize transporting youth younger than 18, or funding their transportation, out of state to access abortion without written parental consent.&nbsp;</p><p>The legislation, Senate Bill (SB)&nbsp;2352 and House Bill (HB) 4595, aims to stop young people from getting abortions by making it a second-degree felony, punishable with fines or jail time, to support them in their journey toward accessing care.</p><p>Young people across the United States already face extraordinary&nbsp;barriers accessing abortion.&nbsp;</p><p>Texas is one of&nbsp;12 states where abortion is banned completely with almost no exceptions.&nbsp;Many other states ban abortion after 6 weeks, prohibit health insurance coverage for abortion care, or force people to receive biased “counseling” and wait up to 72 hours afterward before obtaining an abortion.&nbsp;</p><p>Many states have laws requiring&nbsp;youth under 18 to notify or get&nbsp;consent from a parent or legal guardian before an abortion. Most young people involve a parent or legal guardian in an abortion decision. But some fear that involving a parent could irreparably harm their family relationships, cause them to lose housing, expose them to abuse, or force them to continue a pregnancy against their will.</p><p>Young people in these circumstances can&nbsp;go before a judge to get permission for an abortion without involving a parent, an intimidating and burdensome process known as “judicial bypass.” After researching&nbsp;forced parental involvement laws and&nbsp;judicial bypass in several&nbsp;states, Human Rights Watch concluded that these laws violate young people’s rights and should be repealed.</p><p>On top of these legal hurdles,&nbsp;traveling out of state for abortion takes time and resources, and may require negotiating time away from work or school. Navigating these logistics can be significantly harder for young people.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, after forcing people to leave the state for care, legislators are&nbsp;threatening people who help youth to do so with up to 20 years in prison and potential fines.&nbsp;</p><p>SB 2352 and HB 4595 are part of a spate of recent bills that aim to criminalize abortion support, including&nbsp;abortion funds and other organizations that offer financial aid and help with logistics like transportation, accommodations, and childcare.&nbsp;</p><p>Access to abortion is a human right, and everyone should be able to access abortion without fear of criminal penalties for themselves or those supporting them. Texas lawmakers should reject this harmful bill.</p>

Emirati authorities have designated as “terrorist” 11 dissidents and their relatives and 8 companies, reflecting the country’s indiscriminate use of overbroad counterterrorism laws and contempt for due process.The UAE’s counterterrorism law allows the executive branch to designate individuals and entities as terrorists without any requirement to demonstrate an objective basis for the claim.The authorities should immediately remove the terrorism designations, and the UK should defend the businesses, all of them registered there.<p>(Beirut) –&nbsp;Emirati authorities have designated as “terrorist” 11 political dissidents and their relatives as well as 8 companies they own, reflecting the country’s indiscriminate use of overbroad counterterrorism laws and contempt for due process, Human Rights Watch said today. The authorities should immediately remove the terrorism designations.</p><p>On January 8, 2025, Emirati authorities announced a cabinet decision unilaterally adding the 11 individuals and 8 companies to its terrorism list for their alleged links to the Muslim Brotherhood, without due process. The authorities did not inform these individuals or entities prior to the designation, nor was there any opportunity to respond to or contest the allegations. The move represents an escalation of the United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) transnational repression, targeting not only dissidents but also their family members.</p><p>“Throwing nineteen people and companies onto a list of alleged terrorists without any semblance of due process, and with serious ramifications for their livelihoods, makes a mockery of the rule of law,” said&nbsp;Joey Shea, United Arab Emirates researcher at Human Rights Watch. “The UK government should step in to defend British businesses against the spurious claims of Emirati authorities, particularly as it edges closer to&nbsp;signing a free trade agreement with Gulf countries that appears to lack even basic human rights protections.”</p><p>Human Rights Watch found that all eight companies are solely registered in the United Kingdom and are owned or previously owned by exiled Emirati dissidents or their relatives. At least nine of the eleven designated individuals are political dissidents or their relatives.</p><p>Only two of the eleven have been convicted or accused of a terrorist offense, though both under questionable circumstances, according to informed sources and the Emirates Detainees Advocacy Center (EDAC), a human rights organization supporting imprisoned human rights defenders in the UAE. One was convicted in absentia as part of the grossly unfair “UAE94” mass trial of political dissidents in 2013. The other was accused in a separate case related to supporting the “UAE94” detainees.</p><p>Individuals on the list found out about the designation only after the Emirates News Agency (WAM), the UAE’s official state news agency,&nbsp;published it on its website. It came as “a real shock, it was very difficult,” one of the people named told Human Rights Watch.</p><p>Another said that he was “surprised that our names just appeared on the terrorism case” because there was “no case, no judge’s decision.”</p><p>“I have never been convicted nor there is any case against me,” another said.</p><p>Human Rights Watch searched for the individuals and companies on global terror and financial sanctions lists, including the United Nations Global Sanctions list, the European Union Sanctions list, and the Consolidated List of Financial Sanctions Targets in the UK. None of them are included in these internationally recognized lists.</p><p>The UAE’s 2014 counterterrorism law uses an overly broad definition of terrorism and allows the executive branch to designate individuals and entities as terrorists without any corresponding legal requirement to demonstrate the objective basis of the claim. It does not set out a clear procedure for how this authority should be exercised, nor does it provide for any oversight.</p><p>Designated individuals face immediate asset freezes and property confiscation under the counterterrorism law and&nbsp;Cabinet Decision No. 74/2020. Those in the UAE, including relatives or friends, face a possible sentence of life in prison for communicating with anyone on the list. Human Rights Watch found that the designation has negatively affected individuals’ careers and personal finances, including through lost career opportunities and clients.</p><p>Exiled Emirati dissidents said the designations are part of the UAE’s ongoing crackdown on dissent and political opposition. “They want to hurt us as much as possible,” one individual whose name appeared on the list said.</p><p>Over the last decade, Emirati authorities have repeatedly&nbsp;targeted the Muslim Brotherhood and what UAE-authorities claim is its Emirati branch, the Reform and Social Guidance Association (Al-Islah), in a widespread crackdown. Al-Islah is a nonviolent group that engaged in peaceful political debate in the UAE for many years prior to the crackdown and advocated greater adherence to Islamic precepts. Many of the detainees from the grossly unfair “UAE94” mass trial in 2013 are members of Al-Islah. The UAE&nbsp;designated the Muslim Brotherhood as a terrorist organization in 2014.</p><p>“The UAE government rejects the existence of political opposition or any opinion that contradicts its policies, so it seeks to silence all voices,” said one person named in the list.</p><p>The 2014&nbsp;counterterrorism law enables the courts to convict peaceful government critics as terrorists and sentence them to death. The law has been repeatedly used against political dissidents. In July 2024, 53 human rights defenders and political dissidents were&nbsp;sentenced to abusively long terms in the country’s&nbsp;second-largest unfair mass trial.</p><p>The UN’s first special rapporteur on counterterrorism and human rights has said that terrorism should be defined as narrowly as possible, warning&nbsp;that “the adoption of overly broad definitions … carries the potential for deliberate misuse of the term … as well as unintended human rights abuses.”</p><p>“Emirati authorities are abusing a vague terrorism law to smear and ostracize dissidents, criminalizing even mere contact with them,” Shea said. “They should immediately reverse these insidious designations and cease cracking down on peaceful expression.”</p>The Harmful Effects of Being Designated a Terrorist<p>Individuals on the list said the designation has negatively affected their careers and personal finances.</p><p>A “terrorist” designation results in immediate asset freezes and property confiscations. The Emirates News Agency said: “Financial institutions and regulatory bodies are mandated to take the necessary actions, in line with the laws and regulations in force in the UAE.”</p><p>The designation also criminalizes communication with designated “terrorists” and imposes penalties up to life in prison. This further isolates designated individuals, leaving UAE-based relatives vulnerable to long prison terms for merely communicating with them.&nbsp;“It is harder to get in touch with our families,” one person on the list said.</p><p>Another said that he has been unable to reach his family since the announcement. “I have called several times and they don’t respond, which was never the case before. Now I am calling my mother, my sisters and no one is picking up the phone, it is a clear thing…. Previously I was able to call my mother to talk to her, but now I am not able to reach out to her; this is part of the pressure on the family there.”</p>Lack of Due Process or Recourse<p>The UAE’s 2014 counterterrorism law&nbsp;uses an overly broad definition of terrorism. Article 1 broadly&nbsp;defines a “terrorist outcome” as, among other things, “stirring panic among a group of people” and “antagonizing the state,” without requiring an intent to cause death or serious injury or other elements to ensure that peaceful dissent is not labelled “terrorism.”</p><p>Commenting on the counterterrorism law in November 2020, several UN experts&nbsp;warned that the executive branch “could approve the proscription of any entity as a terrorist entity without being required to legally demonstrate that there is objective reason to believe that such a designation is justified, despite the far-reaching implications that such a designation could have.” UN experts also warned that the law “could contribute to an arbitrary and unreasonable use of these powers,” potentially leading to the “criminalisation or persecution of organisations or individuals that are not ‘genuinely’ terrorist in nature.”</p><p>Article 63 of the counterterrorism law&nbsp;allows for a person whose name has been added to the terrorism list to file a grievance. It says that “the grievant is entitled to challenge the decision of insertion within sixty days from the date of rejecting such grievance or delay of the comment thereof.”</p><p>None of the individuals or entities named in the January cabinet decision have filed a grievance, according to informed sources and the Emirates Detainees Advocacy Center, at least in part because they do not trust the process or institutions. One individual said: “State entities are facades for the security apparatus, which controls all aspects of the state, and there is no independent place that you can address or complain to.”</p>Crackdown on Dissent<p>The UAE regularly uses accusations of terrorism to persecute and harass peaceful dissidents. “These threats and harassment are meant to put you under pressure and stress all the time and not allow you to live your life in a normal way,” one individual told Human Rights Watch.</p><p>Others felt the designation was part of a broader effort to pressure those in exile to return to the UAE, where they would face severe penalties, including by putting pressure on their families and companies. “They are trying to pressure us to go back,” said one person who lives in exile.</p><p>The UAE appears to be escalating its persecution beyond openly outspoken dissidents to include family members who have not participated in politics nor spoken publicly about the country’s human rights record. “Many people whose names are on the list, they didn’t speak loudly against the government,” one person said.</p><p>In 2021, the UAE&nbsp;added 38 individuals and 15 entities to its terrorism list, including 4 prominent exiled Emirati dissidents. Human Rights Watch found that 14 of the 38 individuals and two of the entities are on other international global terror and financial sanctions lists. None of the individuals nor entities added on January 2025 were found on other internationally recognized lists.</p>British Companies Smeared<p>The January 2025 cabinet decision added eight companies to the UAE’s terrorist list. All eight companies are solely registered in the UK, according to the UK’s Companies House. Seven of the entities have current directors who are known Emirati political dissidents or the relatives of dissidents, and one entity has a former director who is a known Emirati political dissident.</p><p>None of the eight entities appear on internationally recognized global terror and financial sanctions lists.</p><p>Three companies are registered to Ahmed al-Nuaimi, an exiled Emirati dissident based in the UK. Al-Nuaimi regularly appears on panels about the UAE’s human rights record and openly criticizes the government’s abuses. Emirati authorities&nbsp;added al-Nuaimi to its terrorist list in 2021.</p><p>One of the three companies owned by al-Nuaimi is Cambridge Education and Training Centre, which offers education training courses to educators and parents as well as camps for children and youth. In 2024, the company&nbsp;organized a “weekend adventure” outdoor field trip for school-aged children, which offered activities such as rock climbing.</p><p>Al-Nuaimi said that the designation has harmed his business.&nbsp;“We lost some of our clients, especially from Arab countries, because they are afraid to contact us. Anyone from a country who has a good relationship with the UAE, it will affect us,” he said.</p><p>Others also said that the designation resulted in the loss of clients. “Clients were not answering me, they were disappearing on me,” one person said. “I was depressed because I felt my business and everything was collapsing.” Another said that all business coming from the UAE to their company had been canceled.</p><p>Another designated company, Wasla for All, offered workshops and clubs to support children learning Arabic and&nbsp;oversaw a second-hand Arabic bookshop in the UK. Its Instagram account&nbsp;shows the company participating at the World Arabic Language Day Celebration Conference and organizing Arabic storytelling, crafts, and quizzes for young children.</p><p>The January 2025 Cabinet decision also designated UK-registered Future Graduates Ltd. as a terrorist entity. Future Graduates helps to facilitate university applications for students wanting to study in the UK. Mohammed Saqr al-Zaabi, an exiled Emirati dissident, was a director and owner of the company from July 2015 to September 2021. In September 2021, he sold his shares and has had no relationship with the company since then.</p><p>Al-Zaabi is the former president of the Emirates Jurists Association, one of UAE’s most prominent civil society organizations until 2011, when the&nbsp;government issued a decree to dissolve its board of directors as part of a broader crackdown on peaceful dissent. Al-Zaabi is now based in the UK and was&nbsp;added to the UAE’s abusive terrorism list in 2021.</p><p>Al-Zaabi said he believes Future Graduates was designated because of his previous connection with the company. “They want to make it hard for us,” he said. “They don’t want us to live inside or outside the country, they want to put us in a cage.”</p><p>The UK government has been pursuing a Free Trade Agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) without any clear human rights protections. Human Rights Watch has urged the UK and GCC countries to incorporate strong human rights conditions in any future agreement and not conclude the deal until there is detailed public transparency around the rights protections in it.</p>

<p>“The Vietnamese authorities abuse the ‘infringing of state interests’ law not only to silence prominent activists and whistleblowers, but to retaliate against ordinary people who complain about poor services or police abuse,” said Patricia Gossman, associate Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “Article 331 is the government’s handy tool to infringe upon the basic rights of Vietnamese citizens.”</p><p>Human Rights Watch examined dozens of Vietnamese court documents, numerous media sources, and hundreds of posts and videos on social media. Between 2018 and February 2025, Vietnamese courts convicted and sentenced at least 124 people to harsh prison terms under article 331. This is a significant increase over the previous six-year period (2011-2017), when only 28 people were reportedly convicted and sentenced to prison for violating the predecessor to article 331.</p><p>In the past, people who were convicted under the law were often bloggers or human rights activists: those the government sought to silence but who were not considered threats to the Communist Party’s monopoly on power. They were convicted of crimes considered less serious than crimes against national security.</p><p>But Human Rights Watch found that the authorities have enlarged the scope and application of article 331 so that it reaches much further into society, beyond human rights and democracy dissidents – most of whom are now in prison – to all those publicly voicing grievances. As a result, ordinary people face arrest and up to seven years in prison for criticizing low-level officials.</p><p>Those sentenced under article 331 include:</p>Dao Ba Cuong, an ironworker who staged a protest inside his home after his son died in police custody in October 2022. A family member livestreamed the protest on social media. Dao Ba Cuong also wore funeral clothes and carried a portrait of his son through the streets to raise awareness about his son’s death. In December 2023, a court in Phu Yen province sentenced him to two years in prison.Vu Thi Kim Hoang allowed her partner, Nguyen Thai Hung, to live in her house and use her laptop, which he used to discuss political issues on social media. As a punishment for hosting him, in November 2022, a Dong Nai court sentenced her to two years and six months in prison. In the same trial, Nguyen Thai Hung received a four-year prison sentence.Danh Minh Quang, an ethnic Khmer, complained on social media about discrimination against Khmer – including withholding aid during the Covid-19 pandemic – and advocated recognition of Indigenous people. In February 2024, a court in Soc Trang province sentenced him to three years and six months in prison.Le Minh The discussed sociopolitical issues including economic development, corruption, poverty, and land rights on social media. He served 21 months in prison between 2018-2020 for voicing his opinions. In 2023, he was arrested again, convicted, and sentenced to two years in prison, also for criticizing the authorities. Le Minh The’s younger sister, Le Thi Binh, also served two years in prison between 2020-2022 for “posting, livestreaming, and sharing” content that “defames” state’s policies.<p>The Vietnamese authorities’ increased use of article 331 is a little-known facet of the government’s expanding crackdown on dissent, Human Rights Watch said. It reflects the government’s failure – despite its growing international profile and membership in the&nbsp;United Nations Human Rights Council – to address social issues in a manner consistent with human rights and good governance.</p><p>“Vietnam’s trade partners have been routinely overlooking the government’s heightened abuse of human rights in the name of economic development and investment opportunities,” Gossman said. “International donors and trade partners should publicly and privately press Vietnam to immediately release anyone held for peacefully expressing their opinions online, and repeal the ‘infringing of state interests’ law.”</p>

<p>Earth Day, which in 2016 marked the opening for signature of the Paris Agreement on climate change, now takes place amid&nbsp;record-breaking global heat and&nbsp;rising fossil fuel production. Yet it also offers a vital opportunity for governments to enforce environmental protections and fulfill their human rights obligations.</p><p>Around the world, the communities most exposed to the extraction, manufacturing, use of, and disposal of fossil fuel products – including&nbsp;Indigenous,&nbsp;Black,&nbsp;rural communities, and those&nbsp;living in poverty – face ongoing rights violations tied to toxic air, unsafe water, and polluted ecosystems. The climate crisis,&nbsp;fueled by oil, gas, and coal, is already&nbsp;displacing communities worldwide.</p><p>One key tool that governments have to prevent such harms is the environmental review process. Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) seek to thoroughly evaluate risks before fossil fuel permits are granted or denied. But as Human Rights Watch recently documented in a&nbsp;submission to the United Nations special rapporteur on the right to a healthy environment, these safeguards are often undermined or reduced to box-ticking exercises. Weak enforcement, poor-quality assessments, and limited information and participation leave affected communities without protection.</p><p>Courts are starting to close this accountability gap. In the United Kingdom, the Supreme Court&nbsp;ruled that when evaluating oil projects, authorities must account for downstream greenhouse gas emissions in EIAs, a decision that could reshape fossil fuel approvals. This month, Norway’s Supreme Court&nbsp;reinstated a ban on three North Sea oil and gas fields after authorities failed to assess their full climate impacts.</p><p>In Brazil, technical staff at the environmental agency,&nbsp;Ibama, recommended&nbsp;rejecting an application by the state oil company, Petrobras, to drill off the coast of the Amazon rainforest, citing deficiencies in the information provided by the company in the context of the project’s environmental assessment, such as in the fauna rescue plan. As Brazil´s government prepares to host the UN climate conference COP30, it has an opportunity to show that bold climate action starts with protecting rights at home by rejecting new oil and gas exploration projects that could harm the climate and human rights.</p><p>Earth Day is a reminder for governments to step up efforts to mitigate fossil fuel harm. Enforcing EIAs can stop reckless fossil fuel expansion and confront the climate crisis at its source. Tools exist. What’s needed now more than ever is the will to use them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This week, US federal court judges pushed back on the Trump administration’s abusive deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who, along with over 200 others accused of gang membership, was unlawfully transferred to a maximum security prison in El Salvador a month ago.</p><p>The Trump administration admits transferring Abrego Garcia in contravention of a court order was an error. But Abrego Garcia, originally from El Salvador, is still stuck there.</p><p>The stakes are clear. As my colleague Juanita Goebertus wrote in a sworn declaration, those in El Salvador’s prisons face torture, ill-treatment, and little prospect for release. Moreover, Abrego Garcia was imprisoned there without due process.</p><p>In upholding a ruling that the government must “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return to the US, the Supreme Court exercised its constitutionally mandated authority to check executive overreach.</p><p>Yet the Trump administration insists it cannot correct the situation.  Instead of finding a solution, President Trump used a meeting with El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, to emphasize that it intends to do nothing. President Donald Trump even speculated about sending US citizens to El Salvador’s jails.</p><p>They clearly can do more; the administration has not even asked El Salvador to return Abrego Garcia. The United States has a long history of securing the release of people arbitrarily detained abroad.</p><p>On April 17, a federal fourth circuit judge appointed by former Republican President Ronald Reagan issued a scathing order, rejecting the government’s claims:</p><p>“The government …. claims in essence that because it has rid itself of custody (of Abrego Garcia) that there is nothing that can be done. This should be shocking not only to judges, but to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear."</p><p>Members of the US Congress have also pushed back. Senator Chris van Hollen of Maryland, where Abrego Garcia lived with his&nbsp;US citizen wife and children, traveled to El Salvador,&nbsp;lobbying on Abrego Garcia’s behalf. Van Hollen reports that while Abrego Garcia is still in detention, as of nine days ago he had been moved to a facility with comparatively better conditions but is still being held  incommunicado. El Salvador’s vice president told van Hollen that the Trump administration is paying El Salvador to keep Abrego Garcia and others in its jails, the senator said.</p><p>Other senators and house members demanded Secretary of State Marco Rubio disclose the details of the administration’s agreement with El Salvador. Members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus have appealed directly to Bukele.</p><p>The fourth circuit judge’s ruling closes with a warning: “Now the [governmental] branches come too close to grinding irrevocably against one another in a conflict that promises to diminish both. This is a losing proposition all around.”&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, Abrego Garcia’s plight represents a challenge to the constitutional order itself.</p>

<p>Luisinho, a 26-year-old man with albinism whom I interviewed in Mozambique, faced a heartbreaking choice: either continue working outdoors under life-threatening sun exposure or quit his job selling second-hand clothes, thereby pushing himself and his family deeper into poverty. He needed to make this choice because he could not afford adequate sun protection.</p><p>Luisinho’s experience is not isolated. Rather, it is emblematic of the systemic barriers that persons with albinism face when accessing life-saving products such as SPF50+ broad-spectrum sunscreen.</p><p>From May 5-9, the 25th World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Committee on Selection and Use of Essential Medicines will meet in Geneva to review proposals for adding, removing, or amending the medicines on the WHO Model Lists of Essential Medicines and Essential Medicines for Children.</p><p>SPF50+ sunscreen specifically for persons with albinism should be included, according to an application&nbsp;submitted by the UN Independent Expert on the enjoyment of rights by persons with albinism. in partnership with the Global Albinism Alliance, the Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in the Context of Climate Change, the Africa Albinism Network, and others. Human Rights Watch&nbsp;supports this application, which presents an opportunity to address the disproportionate risk of certain types of skin cancer that persons with albinism face because of the lower levels of melanin in their skin.</p><p>Human Rights Watch has documented the challenges faced by persons with albinism in accessing health services and protective products, particularly in regions where sun exposure is unavoidable. In Mozambique, eight-year-old Josina’s&nbsp;most-desired gift was sunscreen: a basic necessity for her health that remains out of reach for many. Without consistent access to sunscreen, both Josina and Luisinho are exposed to harmful UV radiation that jeopardizes their daily lives. Children risk missing out on education, while adults may lose their livelihoods due to debilitating sunburns that elevate their skin cancer risk.</p><p>The inclusion of SPF50+ sunscreen in the medications list aligns with&nbsp;WHO criteria: that essential medicines meet the population’s priority health care needs and be available through functioning health systems at all times in sufficient quantities, appropriate forms, assured quality, and at affordable prices.</p><p>The WHO Expert Committee should act on the overwhelming evidence and experiences of persons with albinism by approving the inclusion of SPF50+ sunscreen. Doing so will not only prevent avoidable harm and protect public health, but will also ensure that people in Luisinho’s situation no longer have to choose between their livelihoods and their health.</p>

<p>(Washington, DC)&nbsp;– Increasing violence in&nbsp;Haiti by criminal groups and clashes with “self-defense” groups are contributing to the dangerous insecurity facing the country’s population, Human Rights Watch said today. Criminal groups have been tightening their grip on Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, and expanding into other regions. Opposition leaders and “self-defense” groups have led violent protests against the transitional government.&nbsp;</p><p>The United Nations Security Council should urgently ensure that the UN-backed Multinational Security Support Mission (MSS) receives the personnel and resources needed to fulfill its mandate, and agree on steps to transform the mission into a full-fledged UN operation with a mandate to protect human rights and prevent a further escalation of violence.&nbsp;</p><p>“Haiti’s security situation is in a free fall and Haitians are suffering horrific abuses,” said&nbsp;Nathalye Cotrino, senior Americas researcher at Human Rights Watch. “UN member states should immediately bolster the MSS’s capacity and take urgent steps to transform it into a full-fledged UN mission.”</p><p>Only 10 percent of Port-au-Prince remains under government control, with criminal groups escalating attacks since late 2024. Criminal groups have attacked key infrastructure, state institutions, schools, health centers, media outlets, and residential and commercial areas. They have also infiltrated neighborhoods near Pétion-Ville, one of the few areas not under their control, and where upper and middle classes live and the UN has its offices. Killings, kidnappings, sexual violence, and child recruitment have been reported almost daily, while police and the MSS struggle with insufficient funds and personnel.</p><p>Between late January and March 2025, at least 262 people were killed and 66 others injured in the southern Port-au-Prince communes of Kenscoff and Carrefour,&nbsp;according to the UN. Violence has also continued to affect the&nbsp;Artibonite Department, where more than 11 people were killed in Gros-Morne in late January, and the MSS suffered its&nbsp;first casualty in the commune of Petite-Rivière in late February. In late March and early April, violence spread to two cities in the Center Department, Mirebalais and Saut-d’Eau, where over 80 people were killed, the&nbsp;National Human Rights Defense Network informed. More recently,&nbsp;threats of imminent attacks against the nearby city of Hinche were reported.</p><p>Escalating criminal violence, compounded by clashes with “self-defense groups”—formed by community members often operating in collusion with police—and with law enforcement, has forced more than 90,000 people to flee their homes since the beginning of the year, the&nbsp;International Organization&nbsp;for Migration reported. Many international and domestic human rights and humanitarian organizations have also been forced to relocate or suspend operations, further affecting the 6 million Haitians in&nbsp;need of humanitarian assistance and worsening conditions for the 5.7 million people facing high levels of acute food insecurity, the&nbsp;highest number in recent years.</p><p>“People no longer have a safe place to flee to,” an aid worker told Human Rights Watch. “Women who come here seeking help have not only lost loved ones, but have also been raped, displaced and left on the streets, starving and struggling to survive. We don’t know how much longer they can endure such suffering … All [victims] ask is for the violence to stop. With no support from the police or government, they feel abandoned. They ask, ‘Why is no one helping us? Why do Haitian lives not matter if we are human too?’”</p><p>The transitional government—with three of its members&nbsp;implicated in corruption—established a&nbsp;task force in early March to fight criminal groups, launching&nbsp;drone strikes with explosive munitions without accountability for abuses. Criminal leaders have also&nbsp;threatened to deploy this technology.</p><p>Members of the communities of Port-au-Prince, Pétion-Ville, and Kenscoff, as well as internally displaced people, have taken to the streets in the capital in recent weeks, calling for the ousting of the current government. “Self-defense” group members and police officers have joined some of the protests. In response, on April 7 the transitional government&nbsp;declared a new state of emergency, announcing, among other measures, increased security force resources.</p><p>The government’s handling of the situation has instead led to the reemergence of opposition figures such as&nbsp;Claude Joseph, a former prime minister;&nbsp;Guy Philippe, a former police commander who&nbsp;served six years in a US prison on money laundering and drug charges; and&nbsp;Dimitri Hérard, former head of the General Security Unit of the National Palace, who was&nbsp;charged in relation to the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. All three have called for new protests.</p><p>Amid this growing instability, foreign governments have largely remained silent, Human Rights Watch said. Since UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ February 24&nbsp;options paper with recommendations to the UN Security Council, no concrete action has been taken.&nbsp;</p><p>The paper called for the establishment of a UN support office, funded by assessed contributions, to provide logistical and operational support to the MSS to enhance its ability to conduct robust, targeted operations with the Haitian National Police against criminal groups. It also called for the MSS to be “scaled up in numbers and strengthened with additional military-grade capabilities and lethal equipment provided bilaterally by Member States to address current gaps,” and for strengthened intelligence gathering and analytical capabilities. The secretary-general further requested UN support to non-UN security forces and programs to support those who choose to leave criminal groups and to support the Haitian authorities in investigating, prosecuting, and detaining high-risk people the MSS arrests.</p><p>On April 13, as reports emerge of criminal groups attempting to seize power, the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) urged the international community to take urgent action to support Haitian authorities. The US State Department soon after&nbsp;expressed support for CARICOM and the MSS’s efforts to help restore peace and stability. The same day, Haiti’s transitional government&nbsp;reiterated its call for the UN Security Council to urgently consider “proposals for a significant strengthening of international support for the restoration of security in Haiti.”</p><p>So far, no concrete steps have been taken to increase international support for the MSS, to implement the UN secretary-general’s recommendations, or to conduct other efforts to improve security in Haiti, Human Rights Watch said. The US government, which was the primary funder of the MSS when it was established in 2023, has not provided principled leadership or direction, which foreign diplomats have widely perceived as a key factor behind the continued delay in meaningful deliberation or decision-making.</p><p>“Inaction would represent a catastrophic setback for foreign policy, following years of engagement and hundreds of millions of dollars in investment,” Pierre Espérance, a Haitian human rights advocate, told Human Rights Watch by phone on April 16. “Immediate reinforcement of the Haitian Police and MSS with troops, helicopters, and resources is critical. Haitians are in agony without international support.”</p><p>On April 21, the United Nations Integrated Office in Haiti is&nbsp;expected to brief the UN Security Council on the situation in Haiti. It is crucial for Security Council members to discuss the need for UN member states to provide more personnel, funding, and equipment to the MSS, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>The&nbsp;United States, the&nbsp;European Union,&nbsp;Canada, and other concerned governments across Latin America and beyond should urgently provide personnel and resources to bolster the MSS, Human Rights Watch said. They should also commit to a medium and long-term strategy that incorporates the UN secretary-general’s recommendations, with the goal of transforming the MSS into a robust UN mission mandated to protect civilians and help restore stability and the rule of law in Haiti.&nbsp;</p><p>“The UN has the expertise to support Haitian efforts to restore basic security and start rebuilding the country, while upholding human rights and addressing the urgent needs of millions of people,” Cotrino said. “But the window for action is closing.”</p>

<p>(Istanbul, April 17, 2025) –&nbsp;Türkiye is set to prosecute hundreds of people, mainly students, who protested the detention of Istanbul mayor Ekrem İmamoglu in hasty, mass trials, scheduled to begin on April 18, 2025, Human Rights Watch said today.</p><p>The rushed nature and mass scale of the trials, which lack evidence of criminal wrongdoing, exemplify how Türkiye’s restrictions on the right to assembly are arbitrary and incompatible with a democratic society based on the rule of law.</p><p>“Given the glaring absence of evidence, it is hard not to conclude that the intended purpose of these rushed trials is to send a warning against exercising the rights to peaceful protest or free expression,” said&nbsp;Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “The prosecutor should be calling for these cases to be dropped unless there is direct and substantive evidence that particular individuals committed specific crimes.”</p><p>The first two hearings, set for April 18, involves 189 defendants, including many students, two journalists and five photojournalists. They face charges including attending an unauthorized demonstration and not obeying police orders to disperse; carrying weapons or covering their faces to conceal their identity; and incitement to commit a crime. The last charge is based on social media posts.</p><p>The potential penalties range from six months to four years for the first two charges, with up to five years for incitement to commit a crime. In almost all cases the indictments lack individualized evidence that the accused engaged in anything resembling criminal activity.</p><p>The Istanbul chief prosecutor’s office has announced that is total of&nbsp;819 people are facing prosecution in the scope of 20 criminal investigations into protests.</p><p>Human Rights Watch reviewed nine indictments involving 650 defendants accused of protest- related offenses. One hundred and seven of them are charged only with participating in unauthorized demonstrations and failure to disperse (article 32/1 of the Law on Assemblies and Demonstrations, no. 2711).</p><p>The prosecutor’s office labels the demonstrations “unauthorized” because on March 19, the Istanbul governor announced a&nbsp;four-day blanket ban on all protests and assemblies in Istanbul, later&nbsp;extended by another four days, and ending on March 26.</p><p>Despite the governor’s announced ban, mass assemblies with thousands of participants took place outside the Istanbul municipality building, and students organized peaceful marches from other areas of Istanbul to join in. Moreover, 120 out of 650 people are accused of attending peaceful protests held on March 27, after the ban was lifted.</p><p>Of the 189 defendants in the hearings on April 18, 62 are accused of carrying weapons or concealing their faces to avoid being identified during a demonstration (article 33/1 of law 2911), yet the only specifics provided as evidence in the indictment in terms of carrying a weapon is an allegation that one protestor had a rock in his hand.</p><p>In reality, many people of all ages at the mass protests covered their faces to protect themselves from the effects of pepper spray and pellets the police used on several occasions as well as while dispersing them. Some people may have chosen to cover their faces in view of the restrictions on the right to protest over the past few years in Türkiye, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>Twenty people on trial on April 18 are charged with seeking to “incite a crime” via social media posts (Turkish Penal Code article 214). These posts overwhelmingly consist of generalized calls to join people in the streets and statements against the government and not calls for violence or criminality.</p><p>Seven journalists who were reporting on the protests are being treated by the prosecutor as protesters, and the indictment says that their claim to be journalists “has not been counted” by the prosecutor’s office because the police did not establish that they were present for journalistic purposes. Hundreds of thousands of people participated in the overwhelmingly peaceful demonstrations outside the Istanbul municipal building over seven days after&nbsp;police arrested mayor İmamoglu, together with approximately 90 municipal officials, politicians and advisers.</p><p>Video footage verified by Human Rights Watch shows that&nbsp;police sprayed pepper spray and deployed pepper balls at close range to disperse people and&nbsp;violently detained others, accusing them of ignoring announcements to disperse. Some demonstrators were later detained from their homes on the basis of police video footage showing their participation in rallies.</p><p>Istanbul courts initially ordered the pretrial detention of 278 alleged protesters, placing others under house arrest or imposing travel bans. Out of 40 pretrial detention hearing records concerning 352 people reviewed by Human Rights Watch, 30 individuals allege physical or verbal abuse by police officers. Detainees or their lawyers told judges that police had beaten, verbally insulted, or otherwise ill-treated them as they were apprehended. At least one&nbsp;woman detainee has complained of police ill treatment and verbal and physical sexual harassment and touching. There needs to be a prompt and effective investigation of all allegations of police ill-treatment, harassment, and excessive use of force, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>The&nbsp;Interior Ministry has announced that it is conducting an inquiry into police intervention in the demonstrations.</p><p>About 230 of those in pretrial detention were released two to three weeks later, not least because there has been&nbsp;public pressure about the fact they are students about to take university exams.</p><p>The European Court of Human Rights has issued more than 70 judgments over 15 years against Türkiye. All of them have found disproportionate and unlawful intervention in the right to freedom of peaceful assembly, including through the prosecution of participants and the use of excessive force to disperse peaceful demonstrations.</p><p>The Council of Europe’s Committee of Ministers charged with overseeing the implementation of European Court judgments has&nbsp;strongly urged Türkiye to revise its Law on Assemblies and Demonstrations to uphold the right to peaceful assembly and bring it in line with the case law of the European Court.</p><p>“Violent police dispersal of demonstrations that Turkish authorities deem unlawful is an entrenched problem requiring amending their law and practice to uphold the right to peaceful assembly,” Williamson said. “Abuse of the criminal justice system to detain and charge students for peaceful protest is only the latest instance in a catalogue of cases in which e the European Court of Human Rights has found multiple rights violations.”</p>

<p>(Budapest, April 17, 2025) – The&nbsp;amendments to Hungary’s Fundamental Law represent yet another escalation in the Orbán government’s ongoing efforts to dismantle rights, undermine the rule of law, and diminish democracy in Hungary, Human Rights Watch said today.</p><p>The sweeping legal changes to Hungary’s constitution, rushed through parliament on April 14, 2025, without public debate and signed by the president on the same day, pose serious threats to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people, to freedom of assembly, and to rights of some Hungarians with dual citizenship.</p><p>“The constitutional amendments are further proof of the Orbán government’s authoritarian drive to consolidate political power,” said Hugh Williamson, Europe and Central Asia director at Human Rights Watch. “From scapegoating LGBT people to suspending Hungarian citizenship of dual citizens, the Hungarian government is cementing a legal framework that is hostile to the rule of law, equality, and democracy in blatant violation of EU law.”</p><p>One of the amendments defines gender strictly as a person’s biological sex assigned at birth. This definition effectively denies transgender identities, further entrenching Hungary’s ban on legal gender recognition and limiting transgender people’s ability to live free from both legal and social discrimination.</p><p>Another amendment elevates “child protection” above all other constitutional rights except the right to life, effectively giving the government broad latitude to invoke “child protection” to arbitrarily curtail a host of rights, including freedom of assembly. This amendment is linked to a March amendment to the law of freedom of assembly that will outlaw Pride-related events.</p><p>The government also included a provision enabling the authorities to “suspend” Hungarian citizenship for non-EU and non-European Economic Area dual citizens who are deemed to constitute a threat to the public order, public safety, or national security. A separate law, which outlines the suspension procedure, states that a relevant minister will make the determination on the suspension of citizenship. Critics fear that this will be used to target journalists, activists, opposition politicians and anyone the government does not like.</p><p>This follows parliament’s adoption in 2023 of the Sovereignty Protection Act, which created a special body to investigate anyone the authorities deem to be pursuing vaguely defined “foreign interests”. At the time, ruling party officials said that the aim was to target opposition politicians, journalists, and civil society organizations. The EU Commission in October 2024 took&nbsp;Hungary to the EU Court of Justice over this law.</p><p>Since 2010, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has used his supermajority in parliament to&nbsp;undermine the independence of the judiciary, crack down on&nbsp;independent media and&nbsp;civil society organizations, demonize&nbsp;migrants and asylum seekers, discriminate&nbsp;against LGBT people, and&nbsp;undercut women’s and girls’ rights. For the past five years, by declaring&nbsp;various states of danger or emergency, Orbán’s government has effectively ruled by decree, sidestepping parliament altogether.</p><p>Efforts by EU institutions to bring Hungary’s government in line with fundamental EU values, through&nbsp;infringement proceedings, European Union Court&nbsp;rulings, and&nbsp;suspension of EU funds have had little impact. In 2018, the European Parliament triggered the Article 7 mechanism&nbsp;– designed to hold accountable governments that may be in breach of values enshrined in the Treaty on European Union&nbsp;– against Hungary, citing a systemic threat to the EU’s founding values. A breach of these values may result in the suspension of voting rights in the EU Council.</p><p>These new draconian amendments should raise alarm bells and prompt member states to immediately move Article 7 proceedings forward to a vote, Human Rights Watch said.</p><p>The European Commission should in the meantime immediately initiate new infringement proceedings against Hungary for the repressive constitutional amendments violating fundamental rights.</p><p>“Orbán has shown once more his willingness to trample rights and shred protections, and there is no reason to think he won’t continue on this authoritarian path,” Williamson said. “EU institutions and member states should stand in solidarity with those in Hungary upholding EU values and do everything they can to halt the downward spiral toward authoritarianism.”</p>

<p>(Johannesburg) – On April 11, 2025, Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa signed a law on nongovernmental organizations that sharply curtails the rights to freedom of association and expression, Human Rights Watch said today.</p><p>The Private Voluntary Organisations Amendment Act empowers the government to deregister and seize the assets of nongovernmental groups deemed to be acting in a “politically partisan manner.” The law will severely restrict civic space for groups that are fighting political repression in the country.</p><p>“Zimbabwean authorities have long used domestic law as an instrument of repression, and this new law will allow them to target civil groups,” said Idriss Ali Nassah, senior Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. “Nongovernmental organizations cannot freely exercise their rights to free expression and other democratic liberties when their very existence is under threat.”</p><p>The new law allows the government to cancel the registration of organizations with little or no recourse to judicial review. Violations of the law could result in criminal prosecution, with penalties ranging from heavy fines to imprisonment.&nbsp;Officials also have extensive authority to monitor and control the operations of nongovernmental organizations, including scrutinizing their ownership structures, funding sources, and affiliations.</p><p>The government claimed that the law was needed to curb groups from financing terrorism and money laundering, and to comply with the recommendations of Zimbabwe’s Financial Action Taskforce. Before signing the bill, President Mnangagwa said the law was needed to protect and defend the country’s sovereignty from destabilizing foreign interests and to stop “the turning of a small section of mercenaries in our midst into the proverbial Trojan Horse for attacking our sovereignty, our values and our politics.”</p><p>Domestic and international human rights and civil society organizations, including Human Rights Watch, urged Mnangagwa not to sign the bill because of its expected adverse effects on organizations involved in promoting democracy and the defense of human rights in Zimbabwe.</p><p>United Nations experts similarly urged Mnangagwa to reject the bill, saying that the law’s restrictions “will have a chilling effect on civil society organizations, particularly dissenting voices.”</p><p>When the senate passed the bill in October 2024, the nonprofit organization Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights said the law “completely and wantonly disregards the provisions on association enunciated in the African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights’ Guidelines on Freedom of Association and Assembly in Africa.”</p><p>Mnangagwa has on several occasions threatened to expel groups that do not follow his government’s policies or that intervene in the country’s politics.</p><p>The Zimbabwean government has already sought to curtail the work of nongovernmental organizations in the country. On January 22, 2023, the authorities&nbsp;announced that they had revoked the registration of 291 nongovernmental and civil society organizations. The labor and social welfare minister&nbsp;said that registration was withdrawn because the groups allegedly failed to submit audited accounts for money raised from donors, for ostensible national security reasons, or for allegedly acting outside of their mandate.</p><p>Zimbabwe is party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, which uphold the rights to freedom of association and expression.</p><p>The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights Guidelines on Freedom of Association and Assembly provide that “[t]he oversight powers of the authorities shall be carefully delimited, so as not to infringe on the right to freedom of association.” Furthermore, “[i]n no cases shall inspections be utilized in order to harass or intimidate associations of which political authorities disapprove.”</p><p>Following the adoption of the law, the European Union announced that it had suspended its 2025 funding for the government’s good governance initiatives under the “structured dialogue framework,” because Zimbabwe had “not upheld its own commitments under this process, particularly regarding the expansion of civic space.”</p><p>Zimbabwe has over US$21 billion in debt and arrears with bilateral and multilateral creditors, and the EU has been assisting the country in its debt resolution process. The process, which involves the United States and the African Development Bank, identified judicial independence, freedom of association and assembly, and civil society space as some of the areas that Zimbabwe needed to address to make progress in its debt resolution.</p><p>“The civil society law will further threaten the already compromised rights to freedom of association and expression in Zimbabwe,” Nassah said. “Civil society groups shouldn’t have to operate with the fear that they may be shut down and their staff criminally charged for simply doing their jobs.”</p>

Title    : Trump’s Economic Policies Show Need for a ‘Human Rights Economy’

<p>On April 2, US President Donald Trump announced import tariffs – many above 40 percent, on goods from virtually every country – upending the global economy. Although now paused above a baseline 10 percent, except for China, these new tariffs illustrate the danger of pursuing economic reforms without regard for the impact on people’s human rights.</p><p>The promise to reshape the economy, which was central to Trump’s reelection campaign, tapped into a&nbsp;pervasive sense among many US voters that they were being financially cheated by wages not keeping up with rising prices. Economies should be transformed to ensure everyone can enjoy their rights to food, housing, health care, education, social security, and other economic, social and cultural rights: But Trump’s approach gives no evident consideration to these or any rights.</p><p>These new tariffs are so broad and arbitrary that many economists expect them to be&nbsp;inflationary, hurting those struggling the most. Yet not only is there no apparent plan to alleviate the immediate negative impact on people, the tariffs are also combined with policies already making things harder for many. The administration has&nbsp;slashed billions in spending and fired thousands of public employees,&nbsp;many of whom are Black, gutting programs vital for&nbsp;health care,&nbsp;education, and&nbsp;other&nbsp;rights. Meanwhile, the administration weakened&nbsp;anti-corruption&nbsp;rules and is pushing through&nbsp;tax cuts for the wealthiest, while&nbsp;rescinding rules that increased workers’ pay.</p><p>These measures run counter to an economy aligned with human rights – or a&nbsp;“human rights economy” – which assesses economic decision-making based on its impact on people’s welfare and the planet. A human rights economy is centered on quality public services such as  health care and education and income support at key life moments, while regulating companies and corporate power to prevent them from undermining rights.</p><p>A human rights approach to tariffs would carefully weigh the risk of increasing prices on necessities like food and housing against the potential benefits. Tariff policies should be part of a wider set of reforms that advances rights, such as by using any new revenue to strengthen public services and social security.</p><p>The tariffs also pose a significant risk to human rights in other countries, insofar as governments may end up sacrificing their own labor, health, and environmental protections in a bid for the US to remove the tariffs. This could exacerbate an already dire race to the bottom and compound harms caused by Trump&nbsp;gutting billions in US foreign assistance.</p><p>The problem is not that the United States is being ripped off by foreign countries and immigrants,&nbsp;as Trump contends. Instead, the US government should look to funding public services and regulating companies so that everyone has a&nbsp;living wage,&nbsp;access to health care, and adequate&nbsp;housing.  That may entail sweeping economic changes, but not those that the Trump administration has put into motion. What is needed is a human rights economy.</p>

The Tunisian government has turned arbitrary detention into a cornerstone of its repressive policy, aimed at depriving people of their civil and political rights.Following President Kais Saied’s takeover of Tunisia’s state institutions on July 25, 2021, the authorities have dramatically intensified their repression of dissent.Tunisian authorities should immediately release all those arbitrarily detained and stop prosecuting people for exercising their human rights. Tunisia’s international partners should urge the government to end its crackdown.<p>(Beirut) – The&nbsp;Tunisian government has turned arbitrary detention into a cornerstone of its repressive policy, aimed at depriving people of their civil and political rights, Human Rights Watch said in a report published today. The authorities should end their crackdown against perceived critics and release all those arbitrary detained, in many cases merely for exercising their human rights.&nbsp;</p><p>The 42-page report, “‘All Conspirators’: How Tunisia Uses Arbitrary Detention to Crush Dissent,” documents the government’s increased reliance on arbitrary detention and politically motivated prosecutions to intimidate, punish, and silence its critics. Human Rights Watch documented the cases of 22 people detained on abusive charges, including terrorism, in connection with their public statements or political activities. They include lawyers, political opponents, activists, journalists, social media users, and a human rights defender. At least 14 detainees could face capital punishment if convicted. Over 50 people were being held on political grounds or for exercising their rights as of January 2025.</p>

<p>“Not since the 2011 revolution have Tunisian authorities unleashed such repression,” said&nbsp;Bassam Khawaja, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “President Kais Saied's government has returned the country to an era of political prisoners, robbing Tunisians of hard-won civil liberties.”</p><p>Following President Saied’s&nbsp;takeover of Tunisia’s state institutions on July 25, 2021, the authorities have dramatically intensified their repression of dissent. Since early 2023, they have stepped up arbitrary arrests and detentions against people perceived as critical of the government, targeting opponents from across the political spectrum.&nbsp;</p><p>President Saied fuels security forces’ and judicial authorities’ targeting of dissent, Human Rights Watch found. He has often publicly accused government critics and unnamed political adversaries of being “traitors” and even “terrorists.”</p><p>Authorities have imprisoned Saied’s main political adversaries and prominent opposition figures, including Abir Moussi, president of the Free Destourian Party (PDL) and Rached Ghannouchi, former president of the Ennahda opposition party and former speaker of parliament. Prominent people detained for publicly criticizing the authorities include&nbsp;Sonia Dahmani, a lawyer, and Mohamed Boughalleb, a journalist.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lawyer and former minister Lazhar Akremi was arrested on February 13, 2023, as part of the notorious “Conspiracy Case,” as it has become known, after counterterrorism forces raided and searched his house.

<p>Sihem Bensedrine, 74, is a prominent human rights defender and former president of Tunisia’s Truth and Dignity Commission, which was tasked with uncovering abuses committed between 1955 and 2013 and proposing measures for accountability, remedy, and rehabilitation. She has worked for nearly 40 years to expose human rights violations in Tunisia. On August 1, 2024, a judge ordered her detained on charges of “using her position to gain unfair advantage,” “fraud,” and “forgery” in connection with the Commission’s final report.</p><p>Bensedrine was detained apparently in retaliation for her work on accountability for decades of human rights abuses. She has strongly criticized President Saied and denounced his “incessant assaults on democracy.”  On August 8, 2024, three UN experts said Bensedrine’s arrest “could amount to judicial harassment…for work she has undertaken” as head of the Commission. She faces prosecution in four other cases related to that work.</p><p>The public prosecutor of the Tunis First Instance Court opened an investigation into Bensedrine in February 2023, following a May 2020 complaint by a former Commission member who claimed Bensedrine had falsified the Commission’s official report on alleged corruption in the banking system. The complainant claimed that the final report published in the Official Gazette was inconsistent with a prior version presented to former President Beji Caid Essebsi on December 31, 2018. However, the 2018 draft was unfinished, and Commission members were expected to edit the draft in January 2019, as confirmed by Commission minutes reviewed by Human Rights Watch. According to Bensedrine’s lawyers, her detention is based solely on this one complaint.</p><p>On January 14, 2025, Bensedrine began a hunger strike to protest her detention in Manouba prison. On January 26, she was transferred to a hospital and denied family visits. On January 28, a judge extended her detention four more months. She ended her hunger strike on January 30 due to serious risks to her health.</p><p>On February 19, a judge ordered the release of Bensedrine pending trial but placed her under a travel ban.</p>

<p>Riadh Bettaieb, 64, a dual Tunisian and French national, former investment and international cooperation minister, and Ennahda party member, is serving an eight-year prison sentence for “attempting to change the nature of the state” and “conspiring against external state security. Bettaieb has been detained since February 23, 2023, and has no ties to Instalingo, according to a source with knowledge of the case.</p><p>Police arrested Bettaieb at Tunis International Airport without showing a warrant, as he was about to board a plane to France. Bettaieb was only informed of the accusations against him hours later, when officers of the Complex Financial Crime Unit of the National Guard questioned him in El Gorjani barracks.</p><p>Bettaieb was heard by an investigative judge on February 27 at the Sousse 2 First Instance Court, who questioned him about the Ennahda party and about a 2014 check for 75,000 Tunisian dinars (US$24,000) paid to another suspect in the case. A source with knowledge of the case file told Human Rights Watch that Bettaieb’s defense lawyers provided evidence that it was repayment of a loan borrowed months earlier. The judge nevertheless issued a detention warrant. Bettaieb was also accused of “smuggling cash from Turkey and Qatar” into Tunisia as part of a “criminal conspiracy,” mainly based on pictures found on another defendant’s phone showing Bettaieb with a high-ranking Turkish official, which does not constitute credible evidence.</p><p>On July 20, 2023, Bettaieb was charged with attempting to “change the nature of the state,” “undermining the state’s external security,” “insulting the president,” and money laundering.</p><p>Messadine prison authorities have at times withheld medication that Bettaieb’s family brought him from France to treat symptoms of his type 2 diabetes, his family told Human Rights Watch. They also failed to provide Bettaieb’s medical results after he was admitted to the hospital twice between 2023 and 2024 for health crises.</p>

<p>Former justice minister and Ennahda party leader Noureddine Bhiri, 66, was arrested on February 13, 2023, in his home in Tunis. An investigative judge heard and detained him the next day in connection with a Facebook post in which he allegedly urged Tunisians to demonstrate against President Saied on January 14, 2023. Two of his lawyers told Human Rights Watch the accusation never even provided evidence of the alleged post’s existence. On October 18, 2024, a Tunis court sentenced Bhiri to 10 years in prison in this case.</p><p>Bhiri was also charged as part of the notorious February 2023 “Conspiracy Case.” In this case, a Tunis investigative judge charged lawyers, political opponents, activists, and businessmen of plotting to overthrow President Saied’s authority by destabilizing the country, under numerous articles of the Penal Code and the 2015 Counterterrorism Law. The so-called evidence is limited to two anonymous depositions and private conversations on messaging apps between activists, foreign diplomats, journalists, and researchers. The trial began on March 4, 2025.</p><p>Since December 2023, Bhiri has been detained in a separate case in which he had previously been unlawfully detained in early 2022 and is under investigation in at least one other conspiracy case.</p>

<p>Investigative journalist Mohamed Boughalleb was detained from March 22, 2024, to February 20, 2025, for investigating misuse of public funds and questioning management of public spending.</p><p>Boughalleb was arrested in front of his son’s elementary school in Tunis by officers of the National Guard. They took him to the El Aouina Barracks, where the Information and Communication Technologies Crime Unit questioned him about critical comments on his personal Facebook page, TV channel Carthage+, and radio station Cap FM, regarding the size of the religious affairs minister’s delegations during trips abroad, one of his lawyers told Human Rights Watch. The initial complaint was filed by an official of the Ministry of Religious Affairs, according to the same source.</p><p>Boughalleb spent four days in custody before the public prosecutor ordered him detained on March 26, 2024. On April 17, he was sentenced to six months imprisonment for “blaming a public official of unlawful acts in relation to their duties, without establishing the truth.” On June 28, 2024, the Tunis Appeals Court increased Boughalleb’s sentence to eight months in prison.</p><p>On April 5, 2024, Boughalleb was detained in a separate case, also in connection with public statements. The journalist is under investigation based on at least one other complaint filed by the religious affairs minister, Ibrahim Chaibi, whom the journalist had been investigating for suspected corruption.</p><p>According to his brother and lawyer Jameleddine, Boughalleb’s health condition severely deteriorated in detention where he was faced poor detention conditions and lack of adequate medical care. His eyesight and hearing were affected, and he developed cardiac problems.</p><p>On February 20, a judge ordered the release of Boughalleb pending trial but placed him on a travel ban.</p>

<p>Ghazi Chaouachi, a 62-year-old lawyer, former acting state property minister, and ex-member of parliament, was arrested on February 24, 2023, as part of the notorious “Conspiracy Case,” as it has become known. In this case, a Tunis investigative judge charged lawyers, political opponents, activists, researchers, and businessmen with plotting to overthrow President Saied’s authority by destabilizing the country. The next day, an investigating judge of the Anti-Terrorism Unit of the Tunis First Instance Court questioned him about his political ties and activities before detaining him.</p><p>On May 2, 2024, 40 of the initial 52 defendants, including Chaouachi, were charged and referred to trial under numerous articles of the Penal Code and the 2015 Counterterrorism Law, including some that carry the death penalty. Chaouachi, who was heard only once by the investigating judge, has been charged with meeting or having contact with opposition activists and diplomats and for “insulting the president” in private messages. He has been detained for 24 months at time of writing, exceeding the 14-month legal limit of remand detention under Tunisian law.</p><p>Human Rights Watch reviewed the investigating judge’s 140-page closing order of April 12, 2024—terminating the investigation and allowing the case to be referred to trial—which shows that the serious charges appear unfounded and based on scant evidence. The so-called evidence is limited to two anonymous depositions by a “witness” and an “informant,” which prompted the investigation, as well as private conversations on messaging apps between activists, foreign diplomats, journalists, and researchers. The trial started on March 4, 2025.</p><p>The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention issued an opinion in August 2024 regarding the detention of Chaouachi and seven others in this case, confirming their arbitrary detention. The Working Group called on Tunisian authorities to immediately release them, guarantee their right to reparations, and nvestigatethe circumstances surrounding their arrest and arbitrary detention.</p><p>Ghazi Chaouachi is also accused—based on a complaint by Justice Minister Leila Jaffel—of spreading “fake news” under the cybercrime Law and the penal code, for stating on November 18, 2022, that the Ministry of Justice had been fabricating files against the opposition and harassing judges dismissed by President Saied on June 1, 2022. He could face up to 12 years in prison. On January 29, 2024, a Tunis court sentenced Chaouachi’s son, Elyes, in absentia to three years in prison for publicly denouncing his father’s detention conditions.</p>

<p>Sonia Dahmani, a prominent lawyer and media commentator, was arrested on May 11, 2024, by masked plain clothes security forces who stormed the Tunisian Bar Association headquarters. This followed sarcastic comments she made on the TV channel Carthage+ on May 7, questioning the claim, backed by President Saied, that Black African migrants were seeking to settle in Tunisia.</p><p>On July 6, 2024, a Tunis Court of First Instance sentenced Dahmani to a year in prison for her remarks under Decree-Law 54 on Cybercrime. Her sentence was later reduced to eight months on appeal. But on October 24, she was sentenced in another case under the same decree to two years in prison for statements she made on racism in Tunisia. On January 24, 2025, her sentence was reduced to a year and a half on appeal. According to one of Dahmani’s lawyers, she still faces trial in three other cases in connection with her peaceful expression.</p><p>In August 2024, Dahmani filed a complaint for acts of torture and rape in Manouba prison against the prison director and a guard following rights violations in detention on August 20, 2024. That day, Dahmani was subjected to an “intrusive strip search which violated her physical integrity and affected her psychologically,” her sister told Human Rights Watch.</p><p>Although prisons and other government institutions can sometimes claim penetrative or humiliating strip searches are a security necessity, these practices are often used abusively and primarily to intimidate or punish prisoners. They can also constitute rape, torture, and degrading treatment, and be a serious human rights violation.</p>

<p>Rached Ghannouchi, 83, ex-president of the Ennahda opposition party and former speaker of parliament, is a prominent opponent of President Saied’s one-man rule. Detained since April 2023 in Mornaguia prison in Tunis, Ghannouchi is serving several sentences and faces investigations and charges in over a dozen cases, including some directly related to his freedom of expression.</p><p>On April 17, 2023, Ghannouchi was arrested at his home by plainclothes officers who did not show an arrest warrant, according to one of his lawyers. On April 20, an investigative judge issued a detention warrant against him on charges of attempting to “change the nature of the state” and “conspiring against internal state security.” This was allegedly in connection with comments he made during an April 15 meeting, warning that alienating opposition political movements, including Ennahda and “the left,” was a “project for civil war.”  Ghannouchi is still awaiting trial in this case.</p><p>Ghannouchi faced a separate charge of “promoting terrorism” following a complaint by a former head of a security forces union who alleged that at a February 2022 funeral of an Ennahda party member, he said the deceased feared no “tyrants.” On May 15, 2023, a Tunis court sentenced him to a year in prison and a 1,000 dinar fine (US$320). On October 30, 2023, the Tunis Court of Appeal increased the sentence to 15 months in prison.</p><p>On February 1, 2024, a Tunis court sentenced Ghannouchi to three years in prison over accusations that his party received foreign funding, prohibited under Tunisian law. On February 4, 2025, a Tunis court sentenced him to 22 years in prison, an 80,000 dinar fine (US$25,200), and a five-year ban from public office, in addition to seizure of his assets and real estate, for allegedly conspiring to change the nature of the state, conspiring against external state security, insulting the president, and money laundering, as part of the Instalingo case.</p><p>Prior to his imprisonment, Ghannouchi had experienced Parkinson's symptoms in his left hand and was following a treatment to slow progression of the disease. During his imprisonment, where he received inadequate treatment, it has progressed to his right hand, and has significantly affected his daily life, including his ability to write. According to his family, the authorities allowed him only a few physiotherapy sessions, denied his requests for regular treatment, and refused to give his family access to his medical records.</p>

<p>Chadha Hadj Mbarek, 39, a journalist and Instalingo employee, is serving a five-year prison sentence for attempting to “change the nature of the state.” She has been detained since July 22, 2023, apparently merely for her work as journalist in the company.</p><p>According to her lawyer, Hadj Mbarek’s role was to produce lifestyle content for a Facebook page managed by Instalingo and to proofread other content. She was first arrested by plainclothes security officers at the Instalingo headquarters in the suburbs of Sousse and taken into custody on September 10, 2021. An investigative judge of the Sousse 2 First Instance Court heard Hadj Mbarek on September 17, 2021, and ordered her release pending an investigation. However, the public prosecutor appealed the judge’s decision, and a detention warrant was issued for her in November 2021. The investigative judge decided to close the investigation and drop all charges against her and other suspects on June 16, 2023.</p><p>Nevertheless, the public prosecutor again appealed the judge's decision. On July 20, 2023, the chamber of accusations formally indicted Hadj Mbarek for “undermining the state’s external security” and ordered her immediate detention.  Within hours, National Guard cars surrounded Hadj Mbarek’s family home in Kelibia and officers arrested the journalist, according to her brother Amen Hadj Mbarek.</p><p>Hadj Mbarek has faced poor conditions of detention and a lack of reasonable accommodation and support for her disability. She has a state-recognized hearing disability, and her incarceration conditions in Messadine prison are not suitable for her disability, which has since gotten worse. Her brother Amen told Human Rights Watch that during family visits, they were hardly able to hear each other through the glass and prison authorities did not provide paper and pen to help the family communicate.</p><p>Since her unjust prosecution and her first arrest, Hadj Mbarek has experienced depression and was taking prescribed anti-depressants. “She lost her livelihood and being associated with a conspiracy and terrorism case made her feel like a pariah,” Amen said. Yet prison authorities have consistently refused to allow Hadj Mbarek access to her medication, her brother said, and cellmates “ostracized her,” called her a “terrorist,” and beat her twice while in detention. Prison authorities have since transferred Hadj Mbarek to another cell.</p>

<p>Hamzaoui, 36, the former independent mayor of Ezzahra in the southern outskirts of Tunis, has been detained since May 18, 2023. Masked officers of the National Guard’s Anti-Terrorist Unit arrested him in his home in Ezzahra following an investigation into terrorism-related offenses and “conspiracy” against state security. The officers took him to El Aouina Barracks and questioned him.</p><p>The investigation, which involves 21 suspects including several political opposition figures and former officials, is based on a written accusation by an anonymous informant, claiming that the former head of President Saied’s presidential cabinet, Nadia Akacha, monitored the president’s movements during her time in office and relayed the information to Hamzaoui, who passed it on to other suspects for the purpose of assassinating the president. According to one of Hamzaoui’s lawyers, however, the authorities have not provided any evidence of communication between Hamzaoui and any of the other suspects.</p><p>On June 1, 2023, an investigative judge of the Anti-Terrorism Unit of the Tunis First Instance Court questioned Hamzaoui regarding potential connections with other suspects in the case, including Akacha. As of March 2025, Hamzaoui has not had a hearing since.</p><p>Human Rights Watch reviewed the public prosecutor’s decision to open a judicial investigation and found that Hamzaoui is accused of several terrorism-related crimes and money-laundering, “conspiring” against internal and external state security, “criminal conspiracy,” as well as “insulting the president.” If convicted, he could face the death penalty under several of these provisions.</p>

<p>Chaima Issa is a leading figure of the National Salvation Front opposition coalition. She was arrested on February 22, 2023, and detained as part of the notorious “Conspiracy Case,” in which a Tunis investigative judge charged lawyers, political opponents, activists, and businessmen of plotting to overthrow President Saied’s authority by destabilizing the country. On July 13, 2023, a judge granted Issa provisional release but placed her under a travel ban and banned her from appearing in public places. The ban from public places was later lifted.</p><p>On May 2, 2024, 40 of the initial 52 defendants, including Issa, were charged and referred to trial under numerous articles of the Penal Code and the 2015 Counterterrorism Law, including some that carry the death penalty. Human Rights Watch reviewed the investigating judge’s 140-page closing order of April 12, 2024—terminating the investigation and allowing the case to be referred to trial—which shows that the serious charges appear unfounded and based on scant evidence. The so-called evidence is limited to two anonymous depositions by a “witness” and an “informant,” which prompted the investigation, as well as private conversations on messaging apps between activists, foreign diplomats, journalists, and researchers. The trial began on March 4, 2025.</p><p>The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention issued an opinion in August 2024 regarding the detention of Issa and seven others in this case, confirming their arbitrary detention. The Working Group called on Tunisian authorities to immediately release them, guarantee their right to reparations, and investigate the circumstances surrounding their arrest and arbitrary detention.</p><p>In a separate case, the Tunis Military Court of Appeal sentenced Issa on October 10, 2024, to a six-month suspended sentence for comments she made during a December 2022 radio interview about the military’s role in the 2022 parliamentary elections. She had been sentenced in first instance on December 13, 2023, to a one-year suspended jail term under Decree-Law 54, the Military Justice Code, and the Penal Code.</p>

<p>Abdelhamid Jelassi, a 64-year-old political activist and former Ennahda party member, was arrested on February 11, 2023, as part of the notorious “Conspiracy Case,” as it has become known. In this case, a Tunis investigative judge charged lawyers, political opponents, activists, researchers, and businessmen of plotting to overthrow President Saied’s authority by destabilizing the country.</p><p>On May 2, 2024, 40 of the initial 52 defendants, including Jelassi, were charged and referred to trial under numerous articles of the Penal Code and the 2015 Counterterrorism Law, including some that carry the death penalty. Jelassi, who was only heard once by the investigating judge, faces terrorism-related and conspiracy charges for publishing articles critical of President Saied’s power grab, calling it a “coup” on a radio station, and for communicating with political opponents and foreign nationals about how to engage with other states regarding Tunisia’s political situation. He has been detained for 24 months at time of writing, exceeding the 14-month legal limit of remand detention under Tunisian law.</p><p>Human Rights Watch reviewed the investigating judge’s 140-page closing order of April 12, 2024—terminating the investigation and allowing the case to be referred to trial—which shows that the serious charges appear unfounded and based on scant evidence.

The trial started on March 4, 2025.</p><p>Jelassi has throat cancer and other health complications and needs regular hospital treatment. Since his imprisonment, he has developed respiratory problems and has not received the medical care he needs.</p><p>The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention issued an opinion in August 2024 regarding the detention of Jelassi and seven others in this case, confirming their arbitrary detention. The Working Group called on Tunisian authorities to immediately release them, guarantee their right to reparations, and investigate the circumstances surrounding their arrest and arbitrary detention.</p>

<p>Rached Khiari, 42, a journalist and former member of parliament for the Islamist coalition al-Karama, has been prosecuted on several occasions since 2021 for criticism of the authorities. He spent more than two years in prison for speech offenses, including following two military court convictions, his lawyer Samir Ben Amor told Human Rights Watch.</p><p>An investigative judge of the Tunis Military Court of First Instance issued an arrest warrant against Khiari in 2021, after he publicly claimed President Saied received US funding for his 2019 presidential campaign, Ben Amor said. He was arrested on August 3, 2022. The Tunis Military First Instance Court initially declined jurisdiction in favor of the civilian court system on January 17, 2023. However, on March 2, 2023, the Tunis Military Court of Appeal overturned the decision and sentenced him to six months in jail for “conspiring against state security” and “undermining military discipline, obedience and respect for the president or criticizing the actions of senior commanders in a way that undermines their dignity.”</p><p>On December 8, 2022, while in detention, Khiari was handed a three-month prison sentence in a separate case under the Military Justice Code for allegedly disclosing information about American military presence in Tunisia in a 2016 Facebook post, although someone else published the posts, Ben Amor said. Khiari was released on August 29, 2024, after serving his sentence.</p><p>Khiari was again arrested on September 28, 2024, a day after a Tunis Appeals Court sentenced him to six months in jail for harming the “dignity of the president” and calling him a “traitor” in Facebook posts and in a radio interview dating back to 2021. A Tunis court had previously sentenced him in absentia to eight months’ imprisonment in this case on October 3, 2022.</p><p>On September 10, 2024, Khiari announced that he had left politics and the media to focus on his health. He had been treated for a benign tumor before his imprisonment and has since developed lung cancer with several protruding tumors.His lawyer said that negligence, lack of an adequate medical diagnosis, and poor detention conditions in Mornaguia prison all contributed to the progression of his illness.</p>

<p>Ahmed Laamari, 73, a former member of parliament and Ennahda party member, was arrested on March 3, 2023, and spent more than six months in pre-trial detention under dubious accusations of “forming an organization aiming to prepare and commit the crime of illegally leaving the Tunisian territory.” On September 25, 2023, the Gabès First Instance Court ordered his release, but banned him from leaving the southern Gabès governorate pending trial.</p><p>The public prosecution initiated an investigation into Laamari after a Messadine jail prisoner accused him of plotting against President Saied and sending notes about it to another inmate —former MP, former minister, and businessman Mehdi Ben Gharbia —who has himself been detained since October 2021. Although the informant withdrew his claim in writing a few weeks into Laamari’s detention, the judge still proceeded with the case.</p><p>Laamari was again arrested on December 1, 2023, by officers of the Anti-Terrorism Unit in his home in Gabès. On December 14, 2023, an investigative judge of the Anti-Terrorism Unit of the Tunis First Instance Court questioned him and placed him in detention, his lawyer told Human Rights Watch. He stands accused of seeking to “change the nature of the state” and of “undermining the state’s external security,” “insulting the president,” and criminal association. He faces additional charges under 12 articles of Tunisia's 2015 Counterterrorism Law and could face the death penalty if convicted. Laamari was released on December 25, 2024. The next day, he was briefly rearrested in his hometown of Ben Guerdane and a Gabès court sentenced him to a three and a half month suspended sentence on December 27 for breaching the order to remain in Gabès governorate. At time of writing, his trial for “conspiracy” was set to start on April 25, 2025.</p><p>Laamari, whose eyesight deteriorated due to badly treated, diabetes-induced cataract during his first months of arbitrary detention in 2023, was due to have eye surgery around the time of his arrest in March and again in December of that year. However, he was not allowed to see a specialist regularly in Mornaguia prison and nearly lost sight in one eye. Laamari had previously been imprisoned for more than nine years between 1987 and 2011 for belonging to the Ennahda party.</p>

<p>Ali Laarayedh, 69, former interior minister, former prime minister, and vice-president of the Ennahda party, has been held in pre-trial detention since December 19, 2022, on terrorism-related charges, without credible evidence. The terrorism-related charges are based on a 2015 law enacted after Laarayedh left office.</p><p>Under international human rights law, “No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence, under national or international law, at the time when it was committed.”</p><p>Laarayedh’s detention is part of a broad investigation into how thousands of Tunisians were able to leave the country and join the Islamic State (also known as ISIS) and other Islamist armed groups in Syria, Iraq, and Libya after 2011, when longtime authoritarian leader Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali was ousted. The trial started on October 28, 2024.</p><p>According to the detention warrant reviewed by Human Rights Watch, Laarayedh is accused of failing to curb the spread of Salafism, a revivalist branch of Sunni Islam, and of the rise of the Islamist armed group Ansar al-Sharia, during his time in office. The judge based the warrant on Laarayedh’s decisions and policies in office (or lack thereof), including appointments in his administration, and not specific criminal acts. Laarayedh was only heard by an investigative judge once, on December 19, 2022, throughout his 25 months in pre-trial detention. Laarayedh’s lawyers filed a complaint accusing the police of falsifying key documents in the case file, which has yet to be processed.</p><p>Laarayedh has also been accused, in a separate investigation, of seeking to “change the nature of the state,” “undermining the state’s external security,” and “insulting the president” as well as terrorism-related and other charges, one of his lawyers told Human Rights Watch. He could face the death penalty if convicted. Other public figures, including supporters as well as opponents of President Saied, have been prosecuted in this case.</p><p>Laarayedh was one of the longest held political prisoners under President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. He was tortured and spent more than 11 of his 15 years in prison in solitary confinement.</p>

<p>Abir Moussi, 50, is a lawyer and president of one of Tunisia's main opposition parties, the Free Destourian Party (PDL). She was also a member of the 2019 parliament dissolved by President Saied in March 2022. The PDL officially announced Moussi’s candidacy for the 2024 presidential election on September 28, 2023. Just days later, on October 3, 2023, security forces arrested Moussi in front of a public administration building near Carthage presidential palace.</p><p>On the day she was arrested, Moussi had attempted to appeal presidential decrees redrafting electoral boundaries and organizing local elections. Administration officials arbitrarily refused to register her appeal. Moussi decided to protest this decision by streaming live on Facebook in front of the administration building and was arrested, her lawyer Nafaa Laribi said. Moussi was denied her right to meet with her lawyers until her hearing with an investigative judge, who ordered her detained on October 5, 2023.</p><p>Moussi faces charges of seeking “to change the form of government or to incite people to take up arms against one another or provoke disorder,” and “inciting [public officers] by violence, assault, threats, or fraudulent practices to cease performing their individual or collective duties,” in addition to charges in connection with processing personal data without consent. She could face the death penalty if convicted.</p><p>According to Laribi, security forces used excessive force during her arrest, physically injuring her, and denied her access to medical treatment, which led to complications and her transfer to the hospital on October 3, 2024.</p><p>Moussi faces proceedings in several other cases, including under Decree-Law 54 on Cybercrime.</p><p>The Electoral Commission filed four complaints against Moussi under this legislation between December 2022 and March 2023, including at least two in connection with public criticism of the election process, such as in an open letter to President Saied denouncing the Commission’s lack of legitimacy. Moussi was detained in February 2024 based on article 24 of Decree-Law 54 on Cybercrime following two of these complaints. On August 5, 2024, the Tunis Court of First Instance sentenced her to two years in prison in connection with her remarks on legislative elections.&nbsp;On November 22, 2024, Moussi’s sentence was reduced on appeal to 16 months in prison. At time of writing she is still awaiting trial in a second Decree 54 case.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Rached Tamboura, a 28-year-old calligraphy student, street artist, and freelance graphic designer, has been detained since July 18, 2023, for graffiti denouncing President Saied's policies towards Black African migrants and Tunisia’s migration agreement with the European Union.</p><p>That day, police officers arrested Tamboura on the street in his hometown of Monastir, south-east of Tunis, and questioned him about social media posts of a picture of graffiti on the wall of the administrative building of Monastir delegation, one of his lawyers told Human Rights Watch. The picture, which had circulated on the internet, shows a small portrait of Saied flanked by the words “racist vassal greed fascist” next to the shape of the African continent.</p><p>The public prosecutor accused Tamboura of “insulting the president” and of using communication networks to “produce, spread, disseminate…false news, data, [and] rumors,” to “slander a public official, tarnish their reputation, financially or morally harm them,” “incite hate speech,” “violate [their] rights,” and “harm public security or national defense, or spread terror.” Tamboura was placed in pre-trial detention on July 20, 2023, after his only hearing before an investigative judge, his lawyer said.</p><p>On December 4, 2023, the Monastir First Instance Court sentenced Tamboura to two years in prison, according to the judgement reviewed by Human Rights Watch. On January 31, the Monastir Appeals Court dropped the charge of “insulting the president” but confirmed the initial sentence, according to the lawyer.</p>

<p>Politician Khayam Turki, 59, was arrested on February 11, 2023, by officers of the Anti-Terrorism Unit of the National Guard in his home in Tunis as part of the notorious “Conspiracy Case,” as it has become known. In this case, a Tunis investigative judge charged lawyers, political opponents, activists, researchers, and businessmen with plotting to overthrow President Saied’s authority by destabilizing the country.</p><p>On May 2, 2024, 40 of the initial 52 defendants, including Turki, were charged and referred to trial under numerous articles of the Penal Code and the 2015 Counterterrorism Law, including some that carry the death penalty. Khayam was charged with “harming food security and the environment by jeopardizing the stability of food and environmental systems,” funding a “terrorist” organization, and conspiracy against internal and external state security. He has been detained for 24 months at time of writing, exceeding the 14-month legal limit of remand detention under Tunisian law</p><p>Human Rights Watch reviewed the investigating judge’s 140-page closing order of April 12, 2024—terminating the investigation and allowing the case to be referred to trial—which shows that the serious charges appear unfounded and based on scant evidence. The so-called evidence is limited to two anonymous depositions by a “witness” and an “informant,” which prompted the investigation, as well as private conversations on messaging apps between activists, foreign diplomats, journalists, and researchers. The trial started on March 4, 2025.</p><p>The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention issued an opinion in August 2024 regarding the detention of Turki and seven others in this case, confirming their arbitrary detention. The Working Group called on Tunisian authorities to immediately release them, guarantee their right to reparations, and investigate the circumstances surrounding their arrest and arbitrary detention.</p>
      

      


  
        


  

                    
      





  
<p>The authorities have relied on an aggressive legal toolbox, including unfounded security and terrorism charges under the penal code and 2015&nbsp;Counterterrorism Law, which grants security forces broad monitoring and surveillance powers, allows for a suspect to be held up to 15 days in custody, and permits informants and witnesses to remain anonymous. The authorities have also used laws that breach freedom of expression and the right to privacy, including provisions of the penal code and Telecommunications Code as well as&nbsp;Decree-Law 54 on Cybercrime. They have charged many of the detainees whose cases were documented in this report with “attempting to change the nature of the state,” which can carry the death penalty.</p><p>Tunisian authorities have detained many critics for more than 14 months pretrial, the maximum permitted under Tunisian law. Judicial authorities have regularly brought additional charges or issued new detention orders to keep prominent figures behind bars, sometimes without even bringing detainees before a judge, Human Rights Watch found.&nbsp;</p><p>The authorities’ repeated&nbsp;attacks on the judiciary, including President Saied’s dismantling of the High Judicial Council, have severely undermined its independence and jeopardized Tunisians’ right to a fair trial. They have also&nbsp;targeted defense lawyers with judicial harassment, criminal prosecution, and travel bans for the legitimate exercise of their profession. Tunisian authorities have prosecuted, convicted, and detained civilians deemed critical of the authorities in military courts, which should not have jurisdiction over civilians.</p><p>Human Rights Watch found that detainees are often being held in harsh detention conditions and that authorities have failed to provide adequate medical care to several prisoners detained for their peaceful opinions or political activities. In some cases, they are subject to 24-hour video surveillance, round-the-clock artificial light, or strip searches.&nbsp;</p><p>Chadha Hadj Mbarek, a journalist who has a hearing disability and is serving five years for “attempting to change the nature of the state,” faces poor detention conditions and a lack of reasonable accommodation and support. She has difficulty hearing her family during visits due to the physical setup and has no communication support. Prison authorities have denied her access to her medication, her brother Amen told Human Rights Watch.&nbsp;</p><p>“She lost her livelihood, and being associated with a conspiracy and terrorism case made her feel like a pariah,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>Tunisia is a state party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, which guarantee the right to freedom of expression and assembly, to a fair trial, and to not be subject to arbitrary arrest or detention.</p><p>Tunisian authorities should immediately release all those arbitrarily detained, drop abusive charges against them, and stop prosecuting individuals for exercising their human rights. Tunisia’s international partners should urge the government to end its crackdown and to protect space for freedom of expression, association, and assembly.</p><p>The European Union and its member states, which have largely failed to speak up regarding the dire human rights situation, should publicly express concerns about the deteriorating human rights situation in Tunisia and review any cooperation with Tunisia to ensure it is tied to compliance with international human rights obligations. The African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights should urge Tunisia to immediately comply with the binding rulings of the African Court on Human and People's Rights.&nbsp;</p><p>“Tunisia’s international partners have consistently ignored the deteriorating human rights situation in Tunisia, even as political opponents and critics rack up one heavy-handed prison sentence after another,” Khawaja said. “The international community has an urgent responsibility to do its utmost to seek the release of all those unjustly detained.”</p>

Title    : Kyrgyzstan: Rights Defender Detained

<p>Update: On&nbsp;April 17, the Sverdlov district court ordered Rita Karasartova’s pre-trial detention until May 12. Karasartova is now charged under article 278 of the Criminal Code with making “Calls for active disobedience to the lawful demands of government officials and for mass riots, as well as calls for violence against citizens”. The prosecution claims Karasartova conspired with Kurenov and his accomplices, and that her publishing his letter was a signal for coordinated actions to seize power.&nbsp;</p><p>(Bishkek, April 16, 2025) – Kyrgyz authorities on April 14, 2025, detained a human rights defender, claiming she has ties to a criminal case, Human Rights Watch said today. The activist, Rita Karasartova, was detained for 48 hours in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, with a hearing about extending her detention set for April 16.&nbsp;</p><p>Karasartova posted on her personal Facebook page that the police may have been looking for her because she published a letter from Tilekmat Kurenov, a civil society activist who is feared forcibly disappeared by Kyrgyz authorities. A media report said the police claim Karasartova has “close ties” with the main suspects in a case, who are being charged with “fomenting of mass riots.”&nbsp;</p><p>“It seems that authorities detained Karasartova not based on evidence of criminal wrongdoing, but because she published a letter and is allegedly close to other suspects,” said Syinat Sultanalieva, Central Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch. “She should be freed immediately and no charges should be pursued against her.”</p><p>According to her daughter, approximately 12 police officers, 3 of them masked and armed, searched their home on April 14 without a search warrant, while Karasartova was not there. She was detained outside a shopping mall, where she was on personal business, as the search was ongoing at her home. She is currently being held at Chuy regional police headquarters, outside of Bishkek.</p><p>Kurenov, whose letter Karasartova posted, is a main target in a criminal investigation into opposition activists ongoing since January 2024, in which authorities are pursuing charges of calling for and preparing mass riots and attempting to seize power. Kurenov disappeared from Dubai on April 10 after Kyrgyz authorities spent months unsuccessfully seeking to extradite him from the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Human Rights Watch has seen an interrogation protocol documenting the authorities’ questioning of Karasartova in detention that focuses entirely on her relationship with Kurenov and whether she supports his political opposition to the Kyrgyz government.&nbsp;</p><p>Karasartova published Kurenov’s letter that contained a message to his family on her personal Facebook page. Kurenov had asked that it be published in the event of his disappearance.&nbsp;</p><p>On April 9, the Kyrgyz State Committee on National Security (SCNS) made a public statement alleging that they had uncovered a plot to seize power, and that one of the alleged leaders was in the UAE. The committee said that the plotters intended to incite mass unrest on “ethno-nationalist grounds” to discredit the authorities.&nbsp;</p><p>Chuy district police also detained two other Kyrgyz citizens on April 14 whom they identified as “supporters of Kurenov” on suspicion of involvement in the alleged plot.&nbsp;</p><p>Karasartova is one of over 20 civil activists, bloggers, journalists, and human rights defenders whom Kyrgyz authorities detained en masse in October 2022 due to their public disagreement over the transfer of the Kempir-Abad dam to Uzbekistan. Karasartova spent eight months in pretrial detention before being released under house arrest. A Bishkek district court acquitted all Kempir-Abad detainees in June 2024, but the prosecution has appealed and the case is ongoing.&nbsp;</p><p>For the past year, Kyrgyz authorities have been systematically detaining and prosecuting journalists, bloggers, poets, and civil rights activists on charges of fomenting mass disorder or calling for mass riots. &nbsp;</p><p>Kyrgyzstan’s international partners should urge the Kyrgyz authorities to release Karasartova and not to pursue any charges against her. They should also urge the authorities to provide information on Kurenov’s whereabouts and to ensure that he is immediately brought before an independent judge and accorded his full due process rights, including access to a lawyer of his choosing and an independent medical exam.&nbsp;</p><p>During the first European Union-Central Asia Summit on April 4 and 5, as part of the agreements and pledges made there, Kyrgyzstan made commitments to respect freedom of expression and of association, to create an enabling environment for civil society and independent media, and to protect human rights defenders. It is critical that the EU now hold them to their commitments.&nbsp;</p><p>“Kyrgyz authorities should uphold their international human rights obligations and release Karasartova immediately,” Sultanalieva said. “Criticizing the authorities is not a call for mass disorder, but the exercise of a fundamental human right that Kyrgyz authorities need to respect and protect.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

    <div class="body-text  "><p>Since January 2025, fighting between M23/AFC (Alliance Fleuve Congo), the Congolese army, and their respective allies has escalated. M23 has been progressively taking over territory in eastern DRC since 2022, and the fighting intensified in January 2024, causing mass casualties and displacement. The conflict has impacted people’s access to health care, food, and other basic needs, triggering mass waves of displacement and raising the risk of disease outbreaks.&nbsp;</p><h4>2025 escalation</h4><p>M23/AFC is now in control of parts of North Kivu, including Goma, and has quickly continued its advance into South Kivu, capturing the strategic towns of Kalehe and Kavumu. As a result of the fighting, many people—including those who were already displaced—are <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/dr-congo-msf-calls-dignified-and-voluntary-returns-displaced-people" title="DR Congo: MSF calls for dignified and voluntary returns for displaced people">now on the move again</a>. &nbsp;</p><p>Despite the hostilities, MSF teams continue to provide medical assistance to affected communities through regular and emergency projects in North and South Kivu. &nbsp;</p><p>Armed clashes with the M23/AFC are also taking place in other parts of North Kivu, such as Masisi and Mweso, where we are carrying out medical activities, as well as in South Kivu, where M23/AFC have also made progress in recent weeks, taking over the town of Kalehe and moving the front line to just a few kilometers away from Kavumu. Fighting in the region is ongoing and continues to trigger population movements further south.</p><h4>MSF response in Goma</h4><p>In the first days of the escalation in Goma, the fighting forced MSF to partially reduce activities in some displacement camps and temporarily withdraw some staff from several medical facilities and offices in Goma, however we continued to care for the wounded at Kyeshero Hospital. After several days of violence and looting in Goma, the situation de-escalated somewhat, allowing MSF teams to resume activities in and around Goma. These activities include:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>supporting Kyeshero and Virunga hospitals in treating wounded people;</li><li>collecting and distributing blood bags for overwhelmed hospitals;&nbsp;</li><li>returning to several displacement sites to support local health centers; expand or re-establish cholera treatment units and special clinics for survivors of sexual violence; provide food, water, and fuel for water pumping stations; and empty latrines and install hand-washing facilities. &nbsp;</li></ul><p>Priorities at this stage remain caring for the wounded and reducing the risk of cholera outbreaks, which is a concern due to unsafe water sources, inadequate sanitation, and displacement. MSF teams continue to assess humanitarian needs every day, both in the camps and in the city of Goma, as the impact on the population is enormous. The next few days will allow us to assess the next steps.&nbsp;</p></div>

    <div class="body-text  "><p>Over 8 million people are internally displaced across DRC, including 500,000 who have been displaced by the current fighting since January 2025. &nbsp;The situation for displaced people was already dire before the current escalation, particularly in the camps around Goma. Over the years they have grown more crowded and living conditions have deteriorated further, with severely limited access to basic needs such as proper shelter, food, water, sanitation facilities, and health care. Displaced people living in these conditions face high risk of falling ill.</p><p>For people leaving the camps, MSF is particularly concerned about the level of access to health services when they arrive in their new location. After several years of war, many health facilities have been looted or abandoned and will be unable to provide adequate medical care to those who need it, either now or in the longer term. The situation in the places people have fled is likely to be equally disastrous if NGOs, UN agencies, and authorities fail to provide the minimum level of essential services.</p><p>To ensure a minimum level of health care for displaced people in areas of return, MSF has set up mobile clinics on roads leading out of Goma to the east and the north. MSF teams are also carrying out assessments in the areas to which people are returning.</p><p>Many of the already-displaced people living in these camps are fleeing yet again, as the fighting has taken place in and around Goma. While many are returning to their places of origin—where they originally fled from—others are fleeing across the border to other countries, such as <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/where-we-work/burundi" title="Burundi">Burundi</a>. That’s why, in addition to our response within DRC, MSF has <a href="https://x.com/MSF/status/1891771122338722040">sent a team</a> to Burundi’s Citiboke province to assess needs and provide emergency assistance for arriving refugees.&nbsp;</p></div>

Over 1.9 million people—90 percent of the entire population—have been forcibly displaced, often many times. Water and food are still severely limited, essential supplies like fuel and electricity are scant, and as the threat of disease and starvation continues, lifesaving health care remains inaccessible.&nbsp;</p><p>Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) teams are witnessing firsthand how this war has turned Gaza's chronic humanitarian crisis into a catastrophe.</p></div>

This is why <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/water-resource-more-precious-each-day-gaza" title="Water: A resource more precious each day in Gaza">water distribution</a> is an important part of MSF’s response. &nbsp;</p><p>In January 2025, MSF distributed 500,000 liters of desalinated water per day at more than 64 water points across Al-Mawasi, Khan Younis, Rafah, and Deir al-Balah. Since the ceasefire was implemented, our teams have also started water trucking activities in the north to increase access. We are continuously working to increase distribution as drinkable water remains scarce in Gaza. &nbsp;</p><p>In Deir al-Balah and Khan Younis, MSF has been implementing water and sanitation activities in camp shelters through a partnership with the Agriculture Development Association (PARC). This includes building latrines, distributing hygiene kits, and providing water treatment units.

    <div class="body-text  "><p>The medical needs in Gaza are immense. Many Palestinians require urgent assistance—including people trapped under rubble, pregnant women who are about to deliver, and the elderly—and are not able to access the care they need. The core needs MSF is seeing and seeking to address include: &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h4>Health care infrastructure</h4><p>The <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/gaza-threat-rafah-ground-invasion-looms-silent-killings-continue" title="Gaza: &quot;Silent killings&quot; continue as Rafah invasion looms">collapse</a> of health care infrastructure due to repeated attacks and lack of supplies has made medical care increasingly inaccessible as the overwhelming needs continue to grow. There have been more than 500 attacks on health care since the war started, according to <a href="https://www.ochaopt.org/content/humanitarian-situation-update-221-gaza-strip">OCHA</a>, and out of the 36 main hospitals serving over 2 million people in Gaza, only 17 are functional—and only partially so.&nbsp;</p><h4>War wounds, crush injuries, and burns care</h4><p>War wounds, crush injuries, and burns treatment remain an urgent need as Israeli bombardment and attacks continue. But with very little capacity inside hospitals and a dire lack of medical supplies, people aren’t getting the care they need to heal properly or even survive.</p><h4>Infections</h4><p>Infections resulting from poorly treated wounds are a growing concern, driven by the difficulty wounded people face accessing care and follow-up, shortages of supplies, and lack of access to hygiene.</p><h4>Disease outbreaks</h4><p>Infectious diseases including diarrhea, acute respiratory infections, skin infections, and hepatitis are on the rise due to overcrowding and poor hygienic conditions in camps where displaced people are sheltering, and <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/msf-supported-facilities-across-gaza-face-critical-shortages-medical-supplies" title="Gaza: Critical shortages of medical supplies in MSF-supported facilities">shortages</a> of medicines and medical supplies.</p><h4>Starvation</h4><p>Starvation is inevitable under the Israeli government’s policy of deliberate deprivation, and we are already seeing the impacts of food insecurity and hunger. According to the Integrated Food Security Classification (IPC), almost half a million people (22 percent of the population of Gaza) are facing catastrophic levels of acute food insecurity, and the high risk of famine will persist across the whole Strip as long as the war continues and humanitarian access remains restricted. &nbsp;</p><h4>Maternal and child care</h4><p>In addition to the destruction or closures of once-functioning hospitals, the decimation of infrastructure has created severe obstacles for pregnant women trying to reach medical facilities. <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/what-its-be-pregnant-gaza" title="What it's like to be pregnant in Gaza right now">Pregnant women</a> are often forced to navigate unsafe routes amid the fighting and without safe transportation—often delaying access to health care and putting them at higher risk of complications.&nbsp;</p></div>

    <div class="body-text  "><p>For nearly two years, large parts of Sudan have been experiencing ongoing violence, including intense urban warfare, gunfire, shelling, and airstrikes. The health system, already fragile before the conflict started, is struggling to cope with existing and emerging medical needs while facing overwhelming pressure from the destruction and looting of health facilities, acute shortages of utilities and medical supplies, and under-resourced, unpaid, and overworked personnel. As a result, people face significant challenges accessing medical care throughout the country.</p><h4>What to know about the war in Sudan</h4><h5>It’s led to the world’s largest displacement crisis.&nbsp;</h5><p>The war in Sudan has forced more than 12 million people—over 1 in 5 Sudanese—to flee their homes in the nearly two years since it started, including over 3 million who have crossed its borders into neighboring countries like Chad and South Sudan, where MSF is providing assistance for refugees and returnees. Many displaced people are sheltering in crowded camps established in the aftermath of the 2003 Darfur crisis, with no roof over their heads to protect them from the rain and scorching summer heat.</p><h5>Sudan's health system has collapsed.&nbsp;</h5><p>Sudan’s health system was already fragile before this conflict. Today, artillery attacks, the occupation of hospitals by armed forces, power outages, and shortages of medical supplies and personnel have brought Sudan’s health system to the brink of collapse. Millions of Sudanese lack access to essential medical care despite alarming needs.</p><h5>The war in Sudan is a war on people.&nbsp;</h5><p>People in Sudan continue to be subjected to horrific violence as warring parties attack each other with little respect for civilian life. The violence has also taken on an ethnic dimension in Sudan’s Darfur region, which was devastated by another war in the early 2000s. Refugees who have fled from West Darfur to Chad describe an unbearable spiral of violence, with looting, homes burned, beatings, sexual violence, and massacres, particularly targeting the Masalit ethnic minority.</p><p>Civilians, residential areas, infrastructure, health workers, and health facilities must be protected.</p><h5>The humanitarian response remains critically underfunded.&nbsp;</h5><p>It’s also hindered by restricted access to conflict zones. An urgent-scale-up of humanitarian response is needed to meet the needs of people in Sudan. MSF is one of the few international organizations working in parts of Sudan that are most heavily impacted by the violence. The UN and other humanitarian organizations are barely visible on the ground beyond the main entry points in the east (Port Sudan) and west (El Geneina). This is partly due to the mounting violence, lawlessness, and access challenges imposed by both parties to the conflict.</p></div>

    <div class="body-text  "><p>With a collapsed health system, the medical needs in Sudan are dire, urgent, and exacerbated by the conflict.</p><h5>Food insecurity and malnutrition</h5><p>Food insecurity and malnutrition have reached catastrophic levels in parts of Sudan, particularly in Zamzam camp, North Darfur, which is the largest displacement site in the country. In 2024, multiple screenings carried out by MSF and Sudanese health authorities in the camp indicated alarming and worsening rates of malnutrition. On August 1, 2024, the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) Famine Review Committee concluded that <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/sudan-after-famine-declaration-catastrophic-malnutrition-zamzam-camp-only-getting-worse" title="Sudan: After famine declaration, catastrophic malnutrition in Zamzam camp is only getting worse">famine conditions</a> were prevalent in the area.</p><h5>Access to health care&nbsp;</h5><p>Sudan’s health system was already fragile before this conflict. Today, artillery attacks, the occupation of hospitals by armed forces, power outages, and shortages of medical supplies and personnel have brought Sudan’s health system to the brink of collapse. Active fighting and lack of transportation hinder patients’ ability to reach the health facilities that are functioning. By the time many arrive at a hospital, they are in critical condition; pregnant women often have to give birth at home.</p><h5>Disease outbreaks&nbsp;</h5><p>Before the current war, Sudan had a high prevalence of non-communicable diseases and faced both seasonal and non-seasonal outbreaks of diseases like <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/measles" title="Measles">measles</a> and <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/cholera" title="Cholera">cholera</a>. Now, as the ongoing conflict has disrupted essential services such as water supply and the availability of medicine, the health situation has become even more dire.</p><div class="ckeditor-readmore-wrapper"><div class="ckeditor-readmore"><p>As people flee to overcrowded camps, the risk of disease outbreaks has risen, especially among children. The lack of availability and access to vaccinations has left many children unvaccinated, heightening the risk of deadly but vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles.</p><p>In addition, people with chronic diseases such as <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/diabetes" title="Diabetes">diabetes</a>, asthma, and heart disease are facing serious complications due to lack of medicines and lack of access to functional health facilities.</p></div></div><h5>Surgery and emergency care&nbsp;</h5><p>The war has put intense pressure on hospitals with surgery and emergency departments. MSF teams are seeing war-wounded patients with catastrophic injuries caused by explosions, bullets, and stabbings, and are responding to mass casualty incidents. People injured in road traffic accidents and women in need of emergency cesarean sections also face difficulty accessing care.</p><h5>Maternal and pediatric care&nbsp;</h5><p>Pregnant women and children residing in camps, particularly in the western, southern, and eastern regions of the country, are especially vulnerable to health risks due to harsh living conditions and the insufficient humanitarian response. Women often give birth in unsanitary tents or at home, increasing the risk of complications and infections, while access to <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/maternal-health" title="Maternal health">maternal health</a> care remains insufficient.</p><p>At the same time, the need for postnatal and pediatric care is immense. Children under 5 years old, especially newborns and toddlers, have an increased likelihood of contracting diseases and are more vulnerable to complications from malnutrition, <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/malaria" title="Malaria">malaria</a>, measles, or acute watery diarrhea.</p><h5>Obstruction of humanitarian access&nbsp;</h5><p>Throughout the war, there has been a systematic obstruction of aid, humanitarian access, and supplies. It has been difficult to get visas for humanitarian staff to enter the country and travel permits to move around Sudan. Permits to cross front lines have repeatedly been denied. Attempts have also been made to prevent aid from entering the country, including from Chad and South Sudan.</p><h5>Mental health&nbsp;</h5><p>The war and violence continue to have serious <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/mental-health" title="Mental health">mental health</a> implications for people fleeing or stuck in the midst of the fighting. People continue to experience extreme trauma as they lose family members and loved ones; witness and experience violence, including <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/sexual-and-gender-based-violence" title="Sexual and gender-based violence">sexual violence</a>; and the deterioration of their own health or the health of loved ones.</p></div>

MSF teams work in three border regions that have been hosting most new arrivals: Ouaddaï, Wadi Fira, and Sila, supporting refugees, returnees, and host communities.</p><p>In 2024, MSF provided a wide range of medical services in Chad: primary health care, malnutrition screening and treatment, vaccination, and sexual and reproductive health care. Given the struggle to acquire sufficient, quality water—which increases the risk of waterborne diseases—MSF is constantly working to improve access to water and sanitation. Our teams dig boreholes, build and connect water points in camps, provide technical support to other actors, set up latrines, and rehabilitate water pumps in host-communities. MSF is also intervening in response to an increase in cases of hepatitis E, which is currently an epidemic in the east of the country.</p><p>In addition to medical support, MSF provides refugee communities with non-food items such as plastic sheeting, mosquito nets, and soap, which is crucial during the rainy season to prevent additional heath risks.</p><p>Despite these efforts, the humanitarian response in eastern Chad has been struggling due to insufficient funding for humanitarian organizations on the ground, leaving critical gaps in the provision of food, shelter, water, and sanitation.&nbsp;</p></div>

    <div class="body-text  "><h3>South Sudan</h3><p>Since the war in Sudan started, more than 1 million people have fled to South Sudan. The border county of Renk, which has seen a surge of approximately 120,000 new arrivals since December 2024, has been significantly impacted. MSF is providing medical services to refugees and returnees and host communities in several regions, including Renk, the Abyei Special Administrative Area, and the capital, Juba.</p><p>In Renk, MSF supports Renk County Hospital, offering pre- and post-operative care for war-related injuries in partnership with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which provides surgical care, runs pediatric services, and operates a cholera treatment unit. MSF has set up 17 additional tents to accommodate the influx of patients.</p><p>MSF also conducts outreach activities at the Gossfami, Girbanat, and Atam informal settlements, which host over 60,000 people facing a severe lack of health care services. MSF initially supplied non-food items like blankets and water containers and continues to conduct outpatient consultations, predominantly treating malaria and diarrhea cases. Our teams also run an ambulance service referring patients to Renk Civil Hospital, provide up to 23,000 liters [over 6,000 gallons] of water daily, and are currently setting up sanitation infrastructure, including latrines and water points.</p><p>On October 28, 2024, the South Sudan Ministry of Health declared a cholera outbreak in Renk County, exacerbated by inadequate sanitation and overcrowded living conditions. The disease spread unusually fast to at least seven of the nation's 10 states. MSF has responded in five states, treating cholera patients and administering vaccinations in areas such as Renk, Malakal, Rubkona, Juba, and Gorom refugee camp, where currently over 12,000 Sudanese refugees are living.</p><p>Despite the increasing number of refugees and returnees, significant gaps remain in the humanitarian response. Water supply and sanitation facilities pose urgent concerns; many communities depend on dwindling rainwater sources, which raises the risk of communal conflict. Moreover, food and shelter shortages persist, with many living in inadequate conditions, such as makeshift tents or under trees, while lacking essential needs. MSF is committed to supporting all affected people in South Sudan, including refugees, returnees, and local communities facing dire circumstances.</p></div>

    <div class="body-text  "><p>MSF has been present in Sudan since 1979, witnessing historic changes and escalating needs in response to the rapid shifts in the country’s political and social dynamics, which in turn impact health needs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our intervention began shortly before the Second Sudanese Civil War (1983-2005), which was fought primarily between the north and south of Sudan and was one of Africa's longest civil wars. MSF was actively involved in providing medical care to war-affected communities dealing with massive displacement, famine, and the outbreak of diseases. With the independence of South Sudan in 2011, MSF continued operations in both countries, adapting to the shifting dynamics of conflict and the division of resources.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the war broke out in April 2023, many activities were either stopped or shifted to respond to the emerging needs and emergencies across the country. Some activities continued—in Darfur, for example—thanks to the efforts of our locally hired MSF staff, who continued to work despite the extremely difficult personal and environmental circumstances.&nbsp;</p></div>

    <div class="body-text  "><p>Before Zurmi General Hospital went solar, many of the staff were holding their breath. Some worried about how the change in power would affect medical operations.</p><p>“We have people on oxygen tanks,” said one MSF staff member, reminding the engineers about what was at stake.</p><p>Very quickly, those fears turned to relief. The transition went smoothly, and the electricity remained stable into the following days.</p><p>“Before, it was extremely challenging,” said Israel Mushore, the energy manager who worked on the project for five months. “Patients would be taken into surgery, and there was always the risk of a power cut in the middle of the procedure.

    <div class="body-text  "><p>For years, Zurmi General Hospital had been cut off from the national grid. Instead, it had to rely on generators that consumed more than 3,000 gallons of fuel each month. The system led to frequent and frustrating power disruptions.</p><p>Since installing 436 solar panels this year, the 250-kilowatt solar power system has consistently kept medical devices running and medications refrigerated, as well as enabling emergency surgical procedures. A battery backup system also ensures that hospital operations continue smoothly at night and during extended periods of cloud coverage. Patients in the hospital, including in <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/maternal-health" title="Maternal health">maternity</a> care, the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), and the <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/cholera" title="Cholera">cholera</a> unit, have seen their health care improve. &nbsp;</p></div>

    <div class="body-text  "><div class="text--with-red-top-divider">By Diyani Dewasurendra, MSF infectious disease specialist</div><p><br />Every epidemic begins with suspicion: a sudden rise in illness, recurring symptoms, and the first severely ill patients. In crisis zones, infectious diseases can spread at lightning speed. Every minute counts when trying to contain them. The first 72 hours are critical to save lives and prevent a disaster.</p><p>In 2023, I was on assignment in Malakal, <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/where-we-work/south-sudan">South Sudan</a>, when a <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/cholera" title="Cholera">cholera</a> outbreak hit.</p><h2>Hours 0 – 12: First signs and measures</h2><p>At our hospital in Malakal, we suddenly saw a spike in children arriving with severe diarrhea. In a region with limited access to safe water, that’s a red flag. On top of that, it was March—the final month of the dry season. Since November, there had been almost no rainfall and many water sources had dried up. This region often sees no rain at all between November and March.</p></div>

One of the most dangerous aspects is that the only available water source is often a river—the same river where animals bathe, where people wash themselves, and from which they drink. In situations like this, contamination with germs can have catastrophic consequences.</p></div>

Cholera can be contained with an oral vaccine—a major advantage, as it allows us to quickly and efficiently vaccinate large groups of people.</p><p>Before starting the vaccination campaign for the community, we had to protect our medical teams. Doctors, nurses, and support staff are in direct contact with patients, so vaccination is essential for their survival. Only after that could we begin the large-scale rollout for the affected population.</p><p>Education also played a crucial role. In crisis areas, people are not generally skeptical of vaccines—but often, they simply don’t know that a vaccine exists. As soon as we explained to the first groups the purpose and benefits of the vaccine, acceptance increased rapidly.</p></div>

        <h3 class="alert__title">Facts about cholera </h3>
        <div class="alert__description">
          <p>Up to <a href="https://www.who.int/health-topics/cholera">4 million people are infected</a> with cholera every year, and 140,000 die from it. MSF is active in the fight against cholera worldwide, treating infected patients, running vaccination campaigns, educating communities, distributing hygiene kits, and improving access to clean water and sanitation to curb future outbreaks.&nbsp;</p><h5>Risks and spread</h5><p>Cholera is an acute bacterial infection caused by Vibrio cholerae and spreads mainly through contaminated water and food. It spreads rapidly, particularly in areas with poor water supply and sanitation. Though it occurs worldwide, the highest numbers of cases are in regions with poor water systems and sanitation.&nbsp;</p><p>In humanitarian emergencies such as conflict zones or after <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/focus/natural-disaster-response" title="Natural disasters">natural hazards</a>, the risk of outbreaks increases significantly, as people are often crowded together without access to clean water. Vaccination can significantly reduce the risk of infection and provide long-lasting protection.&nbsp;</p><div class="ckeditor-readmore-wrapper"><div class="ckeditor-readmore"><h5>Symptoms and treatment</h5><p>Cholera symptoms can appear within just a few hours or days of infection. The disease is characterized by severe watery diarrhea, which can lead to extreme dehydration, circulatory collapse, and—if left untreated—death. However, with early treatment using oral rehydration solutions or intravenous fluids, over 99 percent of patients fully recover.</p><p>In MSF medical projects, we operate specialized <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/everything-you-need-know-about-cholera" title="Everything you need to know about cholera">cholera treatment centers</a> to care for infected patients and help stop the spread of the disease. These centers are structured to ensure isolation and safe care, and can be set up within days to respond quickly during acute emergencies.</p><h5>Vaccination</h5><p>The oral vaccine remains the most effective protection against cholera, and currently there is no useful alternative. Administered in two doses, the vaccine provides around 85-percent protection; during outbreaks, a single dose may be administered to protect as many people as possible quickly. The WHO recommends the vaccine for people who live in endemic areas or travel to high-risk regions.</p><h5>Barriers to vaccine access</h5><p>Vaccine production remains a major challenge, as <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/global-cholera-vaccine-stockpile-runs-empty-16-countries-report-outbreaks" title="Global cholera vaccine stockpile runs empty as 16 countries report outbreaks">demand often exceeds supply</a>, particularly in emergencies. The global stock is kept at a level sufficient to respond to epidemics, but to not allow preventive campaigns. A limited number of manufacturers and high production costs add to the global supply shortage.</p><p>During humanitarian crises, vaccines are often not produced or delivered fast enough. Logistical hurdles, such as disrupted supply chains or lack of refrigeration, further complicate vaccination campaigns, especially in remote areas.</p><p>Affordability is also an issue. In Austria, for example, the cholera vaccine costs around $80. While prices vary by country and provider, they remain out of reach for many people worldwide.</p></div></div>

    <div class="body-text  "><h2>Hours 12–24: Isolation and protection measures</h2><p>The top priority is to stop the disease from spreading further. We immediately set up a cholera isolation ward at the hospital. In Malakal, this was especially challenging, as we already had a separate isolation area for <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/measles" title="Measles">measles</a>. We had to ensure that patients with the two highly contagious diseases wouldn’t come into contact with each other, and that other patients would remain protected from infection.</p></div>

Despite being just 16 years old, an initial assessment contested Dona's underage status.

    <div class="body-text  "><h2>A comprehensive response to numerous needs</h2><p>A multidisciplinary approach is essential to meet the needs of extremely vulnerable girls on the move. That's why MSF's program is comprehensive, with teams providing the girls with medical, <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/mental-health" title="Mental health">psychological</a>, social, and legal support.</p><h4>Identifying emergency cases</h4><p>When each new girl is welcomed to the center, an MSF nurse and midwife immediately offer an initial interview to identify any potential medical or psychological emergencies. During this meeting, the issue of <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/sexual-and-gender-based-violence" title="Sexual and gender-based violence">sexual violence</a> is discussed as a priority, so that rapid and appropriate treatment can be offered, including referrals to hospitals if necessary. After the consultation, the MSF team accompanies each girl through the treatment process.</p><h4>Mental health care</h4><p>Alongside medical support, an MSF psychologist holds regular individual mental health consultations with girls who request them, like Maria*, 15, who was born in DRC and grew up in <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/where-we-work/angola" title="Angola">Angola</a>, where she was subjected to multiple forms of violence.</p><p>“I had never seen a doctor in my life before I came here,” Maria said. “I have scars on my legs because they were scalded by the woman I lived with in Angola. She forced me to go and sell water in the village. One day, I came back after not being able to make any sales. She boiled water and poured it over my legs and feet.”</p><p>“It helps me a lot to talk and to be listened to here,” Maria added. “It gives me self-confidence.”</p><h4>Legal support</h4><p>There is also a socio-legal team that provides targeted support to young girls to help them obtain recognition of their underage status, and access accommodations and school. Of the young girls under MSF’s care who managed to obtain a hearing before the children’s judge in 2024, 70 percent succeeded in being recognized as minors.</p><h4>A respite for girls</h4><p>Teams at the day center also hold individual discussions and workshops to address other needs, covering topics like health education and menstrual hygiene. Most of the girls had never had access to this information before coming to MSF's center. Additional activities are organized with the help of volunteers and partner associations to offer a little respite to these teenagers, most of whom only dream of one thing: to go to school.</p><p><em>*Names have been changed for privacy</em></p></div>

Half are domestic workers, often subjected to mistreatment and abuse in their employers' homes.</p></div>

    <div class="body-text  "><h2>Living under the kafala system</h2><p>Migrant workers come to Lebanon through the kafala<em> </em>system, which has been described by human rights activists and organizations as amounting to “<a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/01/04/lebanons-abusive-kafala-sponsorship-system">modern-day slavery</a>.” Under this system, many migrants are overworked and underpaid—or not paid at all—with no breaks or days off. Those who are domestic workers often face verbal and physical abuse in their employers' homes, with serious implications for their health and well-being. These workers are almost exclusively women.</p><p>Under the kafala system, sponsors often take migrants' legal documents along with their agency as humans. Migrants can be denied their right to communicate with anybody outside of the household, including their family. Leaving the house is not always possible, and they can only return to their home country if their sponsor consents.&nbsp;</p><div class="background-tan text-align-center">"I’m scared to get out of the house. Other than for work, I don’t go anywhere. If I face a problem, this is not my country and my family can’t help me."&nbsp;<br /><em><strong>—&nbsp;Beatrice</strong></em></div><p><a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/focus/global-access-to-medicine" title="Access to medicine and medical care">Access to health care</a> is severely limited for migrants bound by the kafala system, which allows employers to deny workers their right to health care. Even those operating outside the system face difficulty accessing care, as they are frequently turned away from hospitals and primary health care centers for not having legal documents, or simply because they’re not Lebanese. Some avoid seeking health services altogether for fear of being turned away or deported, or because they don't have the money to pay for care. This can worsen and complicate medical conditions.</p><p>While some workers are able to find support within migrant communities, many are left homeless, without legal documents, and in need of urgent assistance. Those seeking to return home might not have the resources to arrange their paperwork or buy a plane ticket. Despite the hardships they face, some choose to stay in Lebanon because they need to feed their families, or simply because they have nowhere to go.</p></div>

    <div class="body-text  "><h2>The dehumanization of domestic workers</h2><p>When migrant workers share their stories with MSF staff, themes of racism and discrimination are prevalent. In Lebanon, the term <em>El-Srilankiyye</em> (Arabic for “The Sri Lankan”) has historically been used to refer to migrant domestic workers—regardless of their actual nationality—reflecting the origin of most workers arriving in the early 2000s. As migration patterns shifted, the term <em>El-Ethiopiyye</em> (“The Ethiopian”) became more common.</p><div class="background-tan text-align-center">"This world doesn’t see us as human."&nbsp;<br /><em><strong>—&nbsp;Tigist*</strong></em></div><p>These labels not only reduce individuals to their nationality but also reinforce stereotypes that people from these backgrounds are inherently domestic workers.

Their mistreatment and exploitation have been normalized to the point that even the most shocking stories have become recurrent.</p></div>

Migrant workers are often dehumanized, subjected to racism and discrimination, and exposed to physical and sexual abuse. All this has deep repercussions on their psychological well-being.”</p><p>One of the challenges migrants face in Lebanon is the language barrier, which further limits their ability to access health care as they are obliged to sign documents and communicate in Arabic to survive. But at MSF’s clinic, things are done differently.</p><div class="background-tan text-align-center">“For the 15 days I spent in that house, I would wait until everyone was asleep to sneak some bread or an orange.

        <div class="field__item"><p>When Beatrice shared her story with MSF, the sound of Israeli forces' reconnaissance drones was triggering memories of the day she broke both ankles trying to flee her employer's home.&nbsp;</p><p>It was October 6, 2024, and <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/whats-happening-lebanon" title="What's happening in Lebanon?">Lebanon was under intense Israeli bombardment</a>. Beatrice was cleaning the house when she saw a bomb hit a nearby building. She instinctively tried to flee, but her employer had locked her inside—so she jumped from the balcony, leaving her in need of urgent care.</p><p>"My friends called an organization to see if they can support me with the treatment, Beatrice said. "That organization along with MSF covered my surgery, medication, and the two-month recovery period.”</p></div>

        <div class="field__item"><p>Beatrice came to Lebanon in 2022, leaving her children with her mother back home in <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/where-we-work/sierra-leone" title="Sierra Leone">Sierra Leone</a> so she could earn a living. Yet like many other migrants she has been overworked and underpaid, barely managing to cover food and rent. As the sole provider for her family, the $50 left of her paycheck is hardly enough for them to survive.</p><p>She spent her first three months in Lebanon living with her employer's family, cleaning while taking care of their three children. “When one of the kids was acting up and I had to say no to him, she threatened to kill me," Beatrice said. "She used to say, ‘African kids are not like Lebanese kids,’ but aren’t we all people, just with different skin colors?”</p><p>Beatrice dreams of making enough money to build an orphanage in Sierra Leone, helping children get the shelter and education they deserve. But since her injury last October, she hasn't been able to work. Debts are piling up as she pays rent for a house she shares with three other migrant women. She fears going outside. "If face a problem, this is not my country and my family can’t help me.”</p></div>

        <div class="field__item"><p>Makdes* and her family were saving up money to start a project in Ethiopia. She knew people working in Lebanon, so she decided to take the same journey in hopes to earn enough money to support her family.</p><p>The first family she lived with in Lebanon made her work under impossible conditions. “In my culture, you have to be offered food to eat,” said Makdes. “But they never cared or even asked if I’ve eaten.” Before and after each family meal, Makdes had to clean on an empty stomach. “I would wait until everyone was asleep to sneak some bread or an orange. I was living on scraps.”</p><p>In her last three days working in that home, she was bedridden with exhaustion. Her employer locked her inside her room, accusing her of simply not wanting to work. Later, she was taken back to the agency that had brought her to Lebanon. The agency sent her to another family's home, where the situation was even more difficult—slapped and yelled at by an employer who scared her for fun.</p></div>

She constantly swore at me and humiliated me.”</p><p>That employer also refused to allow her to call home, calling her “just a maid” who “shouldn’t be spoiled.” “She would tell me, ‘Look how they discarded their migrant worker, I will do the same to you,’” recounted Makdes.&nbsp;</p><p>“In Ethiopia, I was never scared of anything," she added. "After my time in Lebanon, I jump at the simplest incident. Now, when I get scared or nervous, my heart starts beating so fast until I lose consciousness.”</p><p>After all she's endured, Mades just wants to go home. She sought the help of her embassy and is now awaiting repatriation.</p></div>

  <div class="field field--name-field-description field--type-text-long field--label-hidden field__items">
        <div class="field__item"><p>Originally from the <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/latest/ethiopia-msf-staff-attacked-after-witnessing-killings-soldiers-tigray" title="Ethiopia: MSF staff attacked after witnessing killings by soldiers in Tigray">Tigray</a> region in Ethiopia, Martha* moved to the capital, Addis Ababa, to provide for her family, working in a hotel during the day and studying management at night.&nbsp;</p><p>One day she lost her job, so she decided to go to Lebanon. Soon after she arrived, her employer sent her to live with their elderly parents and their caregiver. For the three months she lived in that house, the caregiver <a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/what-we-do/medical-issues/sexual-and-gender-based-violence" title="Sexual and gender-based violence">sexually harassed her</a>, but no one believed her. Even after she recorded a video of the harassment, the perpetrator was not held accountable and her experience was dismissed. She was then sent to live in her employer’s house along with other migrant workers.</p><p>“My employer would yell at me if I asked her for anything or asked her a question,” said Martha. “She mistreated me, often delaying paying me my salary. She did not believe I was experiencing sexual harassment. She did not even believe me when I told I her I was sick.”</p></div>

        <div class="field__item"><p>Martha fell ill with severe kidney pain, and once again her pain was dismissed. At first, her employer refused to take her to a doctor. When a mediator tried to convince the employer that Martha was indeed sick, her response was, “She’s under my name [legally], she’s mine, I will take her wherever I want.” By the time Martha was finally taken to a doctor, she was no longer able to walk. She was supposed to go back to the doctor’s clinic for a follow-up, but the employer denied her that right and she became sick again.&nbsp;</p><p>“The house was always guarded; I could not run away,” Martha said. “I told my employer I needed to renew my passport, so she took me to the embassy and I never went back. I’ve been in this shelter for a month now. I want to go back home.”</p><p>Despite the hardships she faced, Martha does not hold a grudge. “I have suffered, yes, but I learned from my experiences. I have not one dime on me, but at least I saved my family from going hungry. No matter what happens, I will always have love in my heart, which is what I like the most about myself.”</p></div>

Two people picked her up from the airport in Beirut, claiming that they’d apply for residency for her, but ended up running away with all her money.</p><p>That’s when the reality hit her: Without a visa to live or work in Lebanon, she would need a sponsor who she'd probably have to live with, and unable to choose the type of work that suited her. The promise of a better life in Lebanon quickly vanished.</p><p>Ahmet started taking odd jobs where she could find them, mainly ironing and dishwashing. Her husband later joined her in Lebanon and found a job at a hotel. Around a year ago, however, he was arrested for not having a valid work permit. He spent four months in jail before being deported to Bangladesh.</p></div>

This past year—living without my husband and through a war—has been very tough for me.”</p><p>"My mind is constantly turning," she added. "I worry about everything.

She spent five years working in a restaurant in Sudan before migrating to Lebanon so she could make more money.&nbsp;</p><p>At 19, she spent four months living in a family's home where she had to work many hours through hunger and thirst. Only then would she be given a small amount of food and water—but forced to eat quickly so she could get back to work.</p><p>Years years later, she fell in love with a Sudanese man and married him. She had hoped for a companion and support system, but instead, her husband abused her, beating and mistreating her on a regular basis before finally kicking her and their son out of the house.

Repeated shelling, shooting at our ambulances, and a tightened siege that prevented us from resupplying facilities and sending staff made it impossible for MSF to continue working in Zamzam despite the immense needs.</p><p>“The communication network with Zamzam has been shut down. We don’t have news of many of the people who worked with us and decided to remain with their relatives in the camp after the suspension of our field hospital. We’re horrified by what they have to endure, and extremely worried about them and the hundreds of thousands of people already on the brink of survival in the area. We were appalled to learn that <a href="https://x.com/MSF_USA/status/1911861206492528846">nine staff from Relief International were killed</a>. It was the only international humanitarian organization still operating in Zamzam.</p></div>

Title    : Deputy Foreign Minister Wu gives interview to French TV

Summary  :
<div class="article-content-part">Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Fran&ccedil;ois Chih-chung Wu said April 16 that China is trying to divide the democratic community and that Taiwan will continue to work with its global partners to safeguard democracy and stability.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Wu made the remarks during a videoconference interview with Darius Rochebin for a segment aired later the same day on French TV network LCI.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
According to Wu, given China&rsquo;s escalating miliary pressure, it is imperative for Taiwan to maintain close cooperation with EU member states including France, the U.S., Japan and Canada to uphold democracy and stability and expand partnership in semiconductors and other key sectors to ensure a prosperous future for all.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Wu said Taiwan and other Asian countries are subject to military threats and coercion from China every day, and European countries are gradually becoming more cognizant of this important issue, with France, the U.K., Italy and Germany all deploying vessels to patrol the region.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The deputy minister said Beijing is attempting to forge alliances with Europe while appropriating European technology and expertise to strengthen its own industrial capabilities, with the end goal of overturning international order.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The open nature of democracy, which ensures freedom for all, can be a loophole for infiltration attempts by authoritarian regimes, Wu said, urging Europe to take the impact of China&rsquo;s grey-zone tactics seriously and not to adopt a pro-China stance.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Wu said a powerful U.S. is in the interest of Taiwan, adding that he is positive that the ongoing tariff discussions between the two sides will lead to an effective cooperation. (SFC-E)<br />

<div class="article-content-part">A news conference was held April 17 in Taipei City to send off Taiwan&rsquo;s team to the 19th Venice Biennale of Architecture running from May 10 to Nov. 23 in the northeastern Italian city.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
According to the Ministry of Culture, &ldquo;NON-Belief: Taiwan Intelligens of Precarity,&rdquo; curated by a team from National Cheng Kung University based in the southern city of Tainan, consists of 17 projects. It will be displayed at the Taiwan Pavilion at the Palazzo delle Prigioni organized by Taichung City-based National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts as a collateral event of the biennale.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Inspired by the biennale&rsquo;s theme of &ldquo;Intelligens. Natural. Artificial. Collective&rdquo; and focused on efficiency, technology and control, Taiwan&rsquo;s exhibit endeavors to identify and construct a gray area within the binary dialectic of belief and non-belief that is unique to the country, the NTMFA said.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
During her remarks at the press event, Deputy Cultural Minister Lee Ching-hwi said the Venice biennale is a key platform for Taiwan to engage with the rest of the world. Taiwan&rsquo;s project is in response to the precarious global landscape, she said, adding that it also spotlights how the country, in the face of political and natural challenges, addresses and reflects on cultural, religious and social issues.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Lee said given Taiwan&rsquo;s unique natural environment and geographic location, architecture plays a key role in how the society learns to coexist and engage with nature. She thanked all participating parties for bringing the project to fruition and making it an essential part of the Taiwan Cultural Year in Europe initiative jointly launched with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs earlier this year.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Echoing Lee&rsquo;s remarks, Deputy Foreign Minister Fran&ccedil;ois Chih-chung Wu said Taiwan&rsquo;s resilience to geopolitics and natural disasters is attracting growing attention from around the world. He applauded efforts by the organizers to bring the country&rsquo;s architectural ingenuity to the global stage. (SFC-E)<br />

Title    : OAC welcomes Japan delegation
Published: 2025/04/18
Summary  :
<div class="article-content-part">The Cabinet-level Ocean Affairs Council received a Japanese delegation April 16 in southern Taiwan&rsquo;s Kaohsiung City, highlighting commitment to jointly developing the blue carbon economy.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Welcomed by OAC Deputy Minister Huang Hsiang-wen, the group comprised Yokohama City Council members Hirotaka Mori and Shuhei Takada, as well as Kanagawa Prefectural Assembly members Akihito Sugahara and Manabu Morita.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Taiwan and Japan face similar climate change and sustainable utilization of marine resources challenges, Huang said. She added that Taiwan is actively promoting marine carbon sinks and has included the goal in the country&rsquo;s pathway to net-zero emissions in 2050.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Huang noted that the OAC has completed blue carbon sink methodology for mangrove and seagrass beds, and expressed hope that after review by the Ministry of the Environment the methodology will be incorporated into the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Report and the carbon credit verification mechanism.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Mori said the delegation&rsquo;s visit aims to share Japan&rsquo;s successful experience of blue carbon sinks and undertake exchange with businesses on relevant technology. The council added that they both agreed that the key to success in marine ecological protection and restoration is local stakeholders&rsquo; confidence and trust in decision making.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The OAC added that Huang attended the 12th annual World Ocean Summit and Expo held last month in Tokyo, sharing Taiwan policy on plastic restriction and an initiative to set up an Indo-Pacific waste management cooperation platform with representatives from over 10 countries. In addition, the OAC has worked with Japan on handling marine waste management, having signed a cooperative memorandum with the Japan Ministry of the Environment in 2023.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The OAC is committed to strengthening collaboration with Japanese authorities in sectors including further carbon sinks, protection of marine biodiversity, the blue economy and ecological rehabilitation. (YCH-E)<br />

According to the MOC, the Singapore-based nonprofit was co-founded by Kathy Rowland and Jenny Daneels of Malaysia and plays an essential role in the region&rsquo;s landscape. Rowland and the group&rsquo;s executive director, Wahyuni Hadi, are also visiting Taiwan with the delegates.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The organization&rsquo;s leaders expressed gratitude to the MOC for arranging the visit to introduce the region&rsquo;s arts critics to Taiwan and said they expected the critics&rsquo; observations to foster global connection and create impactful cultural commentary.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
During their stay, members of the group will attend performances at the Taiwan International Festival of Arts running through May 18 and share their observations of Taiwan&rsquo;s art landscape. They will also take part in the Observers Forum set for April 19 in Taipei City.<br />

<p>TOKYO – The sudden downshift in South Korea&#8217;s exports leaves little doubt about the extent to which Asia is in harm&#8217;s way amid Donald Trump’s tariff tantrum.<br />

In the first 20 days of April, South Korea’s overseas shipments fell 5.2% year on year — the mirror image of the 5.5% rise for the full month of March. US-bound exports plunged by 14.3% in the first 20 days of April.</p>
<p>It’s an early glimpse of the collateral damage to come as the most protectionist US president in more than a century rocks Asia’s export-reliant economies. And it could be an omen of greater-than-feared pain to come.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy commented on the meeting between representatives of Ukraine, the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany that took place on April 23 in London. According to him, the event was accompanied by emotions, but the very fact of such a meeting is an important step towards ending the war and establishing a just peace.</p>

<p>In the same post, the head of state recalled the US position on Crimea by posting a screenshot of the 2018 Crimean Declaration. The document, signed by then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, clearly states that the United States does not recognize Russia's annexation of the peninsula:</p>

<p>In this way, Zelenskyy responded to Donald Trump's recent statements that sparked discussions about the US position on Crimea. The President emphasized that even during the first Trump administration, American policy remained unchanged - Crimea is and remains part of Ukraine.</p>

<p>The Council of Europe and the International Criminal Court will not be able to bring Russia's top military and political leadership to justice for the crime of aggression against Ukraine.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This was reported by Mariia Mezentseva-Fedorenko, MP, head of the Ukrainian delegation to PACE, in the program of Ihor Dolhov on the&nbsp;<a href="http://youtu.be/c3k8h-5KkNM?si=Tr20sLwxsUj3HAIT" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Ukrinform YouTube channel</a>.</p>

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“The Council of Europe is an international organization that has recently celebrated 75 years of activity, but it is still not a court. And it is not an international court, such as the International Criminal Court, which operates in the Netherlands. Although it would not be able to bring the top political and military leadership of the Russian Federation to justice either. There are very specific legal reasons for this,” she noted.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The MP recalled that last year the Verkhovna Rada ratified the Rome Statute, thus Ukraine entered into “absolutely legal, legitimate relations with a body where the crime of aggression can be considered.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“But Russia will not shoot itself in the foot and will not implement such ratification,” she explained.</p>
<p>According to her, the UN court, which was a potential platform for justice for Russian criminals, is not currently being considered either.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The parliamentarian explained that it is precisely because of the inability to bring the Russian leadership to justice for the crime of aggression by existing bodies and institutions that the need to create an international tribunal arose.</p>

Title    : Russians preparing to intensify assault operations along entire southern frontline – military spox
Published: Wed, 23 Apr 2025 18:05:00 +0000
Summary  :
<p><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="127" src="https://uatv.ua/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/630_360_1743930365-571-222x127.jpg" width="222" /></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>Taking advantage of a ceasefire, the enemy has transferred equipment and personnel from Crimea to Zaporizhzhia region. Ukraine’s Defense Forces expect intensified assault operations by Russian troops along the entire southern frontline.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This was reported in a comment to <a href="https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-ato/3985072-russians-preparing-to-intensify-assault-operations-along-entire-southern-frontline-military-spox.html">Ukrinform</a> by Vladyslav Voloshyn, Spokesperson for the Southern Defense Forces.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>"In Zaporizhzhia region — specifically Huliaipole, Novopavlivka, and Orikhiv sectors — the enemy continues active assault operations, especially in the Novopavlivka sector, where they are advancing toward Pryvilne and Vilne Pole. There were 17 assault attempts in that area over the past day. The enemy is also quite active in the Orikhiv sector, carrying out assaults toward Mali Shcherbaky, Stepove, and Lepkove. So indeed, taking advantage of the so-called ‘Easter ceasefire’ and halt in shelling, the enemy regrouped their forces, moved personnel from assault units, their weapons, and military equipment to frontline positions, and continues to conduct assaults in small infantry groups," Voloshyn said.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>When asked whether the enemy is concentrating fresh forces only in Zaporizhzhia direction, the Spokesperson said it concerns all southern directions.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>"According to our intelligence, the enemy is regrouping and redeploying a certain amount of forces and resources from both Crimea and Russia to continue assault operations. We are recording an increase in the amount of weaponry, military equipment, and assault units across all southern sectors of the front — especially in the areas of Huliaipole, Novopavlivka, and Orikhiv. We also observe a buildup of these assault units in the Prydniprovske sector, near the settlement of Oleshky. Therefore, we do not rule out intensified assault operations in Zaporizhzhia region itself, as well as increased enemy activity in Kherson direction. The enemy is currently accumulating forces and resources, conducting logistical preparations, and constantly carrying out reconnaissance," Voloshyn said.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>At the same time, Voloshyn noted that while the Russian invaders do not yet have sufficient forces for a full-scale offensive, they do have enough to conduct assault operations in small infantry groups with the support of combat vehicles.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>A particular role in supplying the enemy’s assault groups is now played by light motorized vehicles.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>"According to our intelligence, light motorized vehicles — such as motorcycles, buggies, and quad bikes — are now playing a key role. The enemy has recently started actively using them in assault operations. These vehicles can move quickly through fields, are highly maneuverable, and are difficult to target or destroy using both conventional fire and FPV drones. That’s why the enemy has increasingly turned to using them," the Spokesperson explained.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>He noted that Ukrainian defenders destroy around 20 motorcycles and 5–7 buggies and quad bikes every day.</p>

<p>As reported by Ukrinform, over the past 24 hours, the occupiers carried out 359 strikes on 13 settlements in Zaporizhzhia region. One person was killed and 40 others were injured in an attack on Zaporizhzhia.</p>

Title    : Council of Europe expects up to 6M claims to Damage Register from Ukrainians – MP
Published: Wed, 23 Apr 2025 17:06:00 +0000

<p><img alt="" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" height="127" src="https://uatv.ua/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/630_360_1541761461-849-222x127.jpg" width="222" /></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>The Council of Europe anticipates up to 6 million claims to the Damage Register from Ukrainians affected by Russian aggression.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This was announced by Member of Parliament and head of the Ukrainian delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), Maria Mezentseva-Fedorenko, in a program hosted by Ihor Dolhov on&nbsp;<a href="http://youtu.be/c3k8h-5KkNM?si=Tr20sLwxsUj3HAIT" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Ukrinform’s YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“It’s important that accountability for aggression is now directly and practically linked to something every Ukrainian can do on their phone today. Applications for compensation in nine categories — covering both material and non-material losses — can be submitted through the Diia app,” Mezentseva said.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>According to her, a European Commission team from the Damage Register has recently arrived in Kyiv, and an official office has been opened in Ukraine to offer consultations to victims.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“Not everyone knows that even if you have already received compensation from the state, you can still submit an application to the Register. These are two separate processes that do not overlap. You can also submit claims to the Register if your situation falls under several categories or even all of them,” Mezentseva-Fedorenko added.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>So far, over 20,000 claims have been submitted by Ukrainians to the Damage Register. However, Council of Europe officials have projected up to 6 million claims.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>“We must ensure the capacity of this process and not disappoint our citizens. Funding remains a key issue,” Mezentseva noted.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As Ukrinform previously reported, the Council of Europe and the International Criminal Court (ICC) are unable to hold Russia’s top military-political leadership accountable for the crime of aggression against Ukraine under their current jurisdictions.</p>

Title    : China opposes Ukraine’s accusations of assisting Russia in manufacturing military goods

<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs has dismissed Ukraine’s accusations regarding Chinese companies' involvement in the production of military goods for Russia, calling them ‘unwarranted’.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>This statement was made by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun, in response to the summoning of China’s ambassador by Ukraine’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, according to <a href="https://www.ukrinform.net/rubric-polytics/3985133-china-opposes-ukraines-accusations-of-assisting-russia-in-manufacturing-military-goods.html">Ukrinform</a>, citing <a href="http://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202504/1332698.shtml" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Global Times</a>.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>"We have already made clear China's position on the relevant issues. China firmly opposes unwarranted accusations and political manipulation," the spokesperson said.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>As reported by Ukrinform, on April 22, Chinese Ambassador Ma Shengkun was summoned to the Ukrainian MFA over allegations that Chinese nationals were involved in combat on Russia’s side and that Chinese companies were producing weapons within Russian territory.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>During the meeting, Deputy Foreign Minister Yevhen Perebyinis emphasized that evidence of Chinese citizens participating in the war against Ukraine, as well as Chinese companies being involved in military production in Russia, raises serious concerns and contradicts the spirit of partnership between Ukraine and China.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>President Volodymyr Zelenskyy previously stated on April 7 that Ukraine had obtained information indicating that China was supplying weapons to Russia — specifically gunpowder and artillery.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>
<p>In response, Beijing denied on April 18 that it had supplied lethal weapons to any party in the war.</p>

<p>The United Kingdom remains “absolutely committed” to securing a just and lasting peace in Ukraine.<br />This was stated by the spokesman for British Prime Minister Keir Starmer after U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio refused to participate in the talks in London on Wednesday, <a href="https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-polytics/3985208-recnik-starmera-britania-viddana-spravedlivomu-ta-trivalomu-miru-v-ukraini.html">Ukrinform</a> reports citing The <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2025/apr/23/russia-ukraine-war-live-london-peace-talks-macron-starmer-zelenskyy-putin-latest-news-updates?CMP=share_btn_url&amp;page=with%3Ablock-680897138f0887d718c2e528#top-of-blog">Guardian</a>.</p>

<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>

<p>This was stated in a comment to <a href="https://www.afp.com/">AFP</a> by the office of French President Emmanuel Macron.</p>

Title    : Trump’s Approval Rating Falls in the U.S.

<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>U.S. President Donald Trump's approval rating has dropped to its lowest level since his return to the White House.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>This is according to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-approval-rating-dips-many-wary-his-wielding-power-reutersipsos-poll-finds-2025-04-21/?fbclid=IwY2xjawJz98pleHRuA2FlbQIxMAABHvrNcVwvFjSoZlX_GZ94Q8qFzDa3UGbRDPEUMIyma7zgldnmGlJ1JVtylgGI_aem_cMyoufWrprBIO3ZKPNDMtw">Reuters/Ipsos</a> poll.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>About 42% of respondents in the six-day survey approved of Trump’s performance as president. Three weeks ago, the same poll showed 43%, and right after Trump’s inauguration in January, the figure stood at 47%.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>The beginning of Trump’s new term shocked his political opponents, as he signed dozens of executive orders expanding his influence over both government agencies and private institutions such as universities and law firms.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>Although Trump’s rating remains higher than during most of Democratic predecessor Joe Biden’s presidency, the Reuters/Ipsos poll indicates that many Americans are dissatisfied with his actions.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>About 83% of the 4,306 respondents said that the U.S. president must comply with federal court decisions, even if he disagrees with them.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>57% disagreed with the statement that “it’s okay for a U.S. president to cut off funding to universities if he disagrees with how they are run.”</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>66% do not believe the president should control leading cultural institutions such as national museums and theaters.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>The poll showed that on a range of issues—from inflation and immigration to taxation and the rule of law—more Americans disapprove of Trump’s performance than approve, on every single topic covered.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>Regarding immigration, his strongest area of support, 45% approved of Trump’s performance, while 46% disapproved.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>About 59% of respondents, including a third of Republicans, said that America is losing credibility on the global stage. The poll has a margin of error of about 2 percentage points.</p>
<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>
<p><!-- wp:paragraph {"className":""} --></p>
<p>Meanwhile, recently published results from a Gallup poll showed that Trump’s approval rating in the first quarter of his second term was 45%—higher than for the same period during his first term.</p>

Title    : Despite Putin’s denials, Russia’s military has welcomed foreign mercenaries from at least 48 nations — iStories

Summary  :
<p>More than a year into the invasion of Ukraine, in September 2023, Vladimir Putin declared that Russia had no need for foreign mercenaries. The nation’s homegrown supply of fighting men was more than enough, he explained. However, according to a new investigation by the news outlet iStories, mercenaries from at least 48 countries have joined the Russian military throughout the war. Journalists studied a leaked copy of Russia’s Unified Medical Information and Analytical System database and calculated that army recruiters in Moscow alone enlisted more than 1,500 foreign nationals between April 2023 and May 2024. All these recruits listed the same address as their place of residence: a single army enlistment center at 5 Yablochkova Street, Building 1. Meduza summarizes what iStories discovered.<p>

Title    : Breaking the ice. As the U.S. and Russia tease Arctic cooperation, climate science could offer common ground — but neither side seems interested
Published: Tue, 22 Apr 2025 16:04:04 +0300
Summary  :
<p>Since returning to the White House, Donald Trump has overseen a rapid thaw in relations with Moscow. Among the more curious points of alignment: a renewed focus on the Arctic. Despite Russia’s ongoing war against Ukraine — the very conflict that fractured U.S.–Russia ties — both countries have begun speaking, at least in broad strokes, about possible cooperation in the world’s northernmost region. Proposals range from sharing sea lanes to joint energy development projects. But with sanctions still in place and trust in short supply, scientific research now appears to be the easiest, least politically fraught arena for renewed engagement. Even there, though, the two sides may be further apart than they seem. To understand how climate science, geopolitics, and Arctic ambitions collide, Meduza spoke with two leading experts: Arild Moe of the Fridtjof Nansen Institute and Ilia Shumanov, director of the Arctida project.<p>

Published: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 19:52:21 +0300
Summary  :
<p>Vladimir Putin acknowledged on Monday that Russia has repeatedly attacked civilian sites in Ukraine, arguing that these strikes target Ukrainian soldiers and military infrastructure staged in residential and commercial areas. In comments to state television correspondent Pavel Zarubin, the president referred directly to Russia’s April 13 strike in downtown Sumy, which killed at least 35 people and injured more than 125. Putin said the attack targeted Ukrainian servicemen assembled that morning to be honored for their participation in the incursion into Russia’s Kursk region:<p>

Title    : 'He kissed up well'. Artyom Zhoga was supposed to embody Putin’s new model of veterans in high places. So far, his performance has fallen flat.
Published: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 18:59:55 +0300
Summary  :
<p>In his February 2024 address to Russia’s Federal Assembly, Vladimir Putin called for veterans of the war in Ukraine to become the country’s “new elites” and to hold “leading positions” in government. In the approximately 14 months since then, this initiative has brought few success stories — though not for lack of trying. One of the most visible of these “new elites” is Artyom Zhoga, a former commander of the pro-Russian separatist Sparta Battalion in Ukraine’s Donetsk region who's spent the last six months serving as Putin’s official envoy to the Ural Federal District. In 2023, Zhoga publicly asked Putin to run for a fifth term, playing a key role in the president’s campaign announcement and raising his own profile. Since his big promotion, however, he's largely failed to become a full-fledged official; he currently spends most of his time meeting with soldiers and defense industry workers, attending ceremonies and celebrations, and making appearances at sporting events. Meduza special correspondent Andrey Pertsev explains why no one's holding their breath for Zhoga to start making his own political decisions.<p>

Title    : 'Wiping out neighborhood after neighborhood'. Russia pounds Ukraine's Pokrovsk, forcing civilians to flee under fire. For many, it's not the first time.
Published: Mon, 21 Apr 2025 16:26:58 +0300
Summary  :
<p>Russian forces are continuing their offensive near Pokrovsk in Ukraine’s Donetsk region. In its Monday morning update, Ukraine’s General Staff reported that Russian troops had launched 39 attacks on the Pokrovsk front over the previous 24 hours — more than on any other section of the frontline. As Meduza reported in early April, Russia has redeployed significant forces from the Toretsk area to Pokrovsk, a shift that allowed Ukrainian troops to regain control over part of Toretsk’s city center and its western outskirts. Meanwhile, Pokrovsk remains under constant assault from Russian drones, artillery, and bombing. “KAB [guided bombs] are wiping out neighborhood after neighborhood — 30 to 60 strikes a day,” said Ukrainian photographer Kostiantyn Liberov, who visited Pokrovsk in the first half of April. According to a Ukrainian military lieutenant with the callsign “Aleks” who spoke to the news agency UNIAN, Russian forces have not managed to capture Pokrovsk, but the city is “basically being torn to pieces.” “With this level of fighting, unfortunately, Pokrovsk is headed for the same fate as Bakhmut,” he said. Pokrovsk currently serves as Ukraine’s main logistical hub for its forces in central Donbas. It’s also a base for Ukrainian drone operators, who have managed to slow Russia’s advance towards the city for several months. According to Forbes correspondent David Axe, Russian troops met a “wall of drones” when they reached the city's suburbs. Below, Meduza shares photographs taken in Pokrovsk on April 12. The strikes have continued daily since then (though their intensity waned briefly during the "Easter truce").<p>

Title    : Statement on ISW Methodology
Published: Fri, 05 May 2023 01:23:40 +0000
Summary  :
<div class="field field-name-field-cover-image field-type-image field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><img alt="" height="125" src="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/styles/square_thumbnail/public/ISW%20LOGO%202_153.jpg?itok=kxannOZ8" width="125" /></div></div></div><div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p align="center" style="text-align: left;"><strong>Statement on ISW Methodology</strong></p>
<p align="center" style="text-align: left;"><strong>May 4, 2023</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) welcomes robust and rigorous debate on the issues ISW covers and is especially grateful for the interaction with and feedback from those who engage seriously with the methodological challenges of performing intelligence from publicly available information. ISW’s entire team shares a passion for sound tradecraft and a desire to engage openly regarding our methodology, including our analytic and forecasting successes as well as our limitations. We seek to raise the general level of discussion of national security and especially military issues and are grateful for the aid of all who contribute to that effort.</p>
<p>A few key takeaways regarding ISW’s approach can help inform readers about ISW’s work and establish constructive topics for engagement:</p>
<ul><li>ISW applies rigorous intelligence tradecraft that reflects best practices drawn from the US intelligence community. ISW uses technical language from the military and intelligence community in its products in order to maintain the rigor of its tradecraft and communicate with the greatest possible precision.</li>
<li>ISW’s extensive, daily collection and analysis provides a highly tested baseline of existing patterns, enabling relatively fast identification of anomalies and inflections. ISW’s ability to make a judgment on a given piece of data is informed by its months of prior study.</li>
<li>ISW has applied its proven methodology for analyzing conflicts for over 15 years. ISW’s Ukraine work applies the same tradecraft ISW has used to analyze and map other wars, including ISW’s extensive coverage of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria.</li>
<li>ISW is fully independent of the US and foreign governments, takes no money from these entities, and is committed to its independence as a key source of objectivity.</li>
<li>ISW aims to inform, not convince, audiences and makes available the sourcing of each product to ensure readers can engage directly with the underlying data and form their own conclusions, especially amidst disinformation campaigns. ISW uses no classified or privileged information in its products.</li>
<li>ISW analysts interpret available data to form assessments – they do not simply report facts. ISW explicitly states its specific confidence level in each assessment whenever applicable and encourages our readers to include it when reporting our assessments in order to minimize the risk of misinterpretation. ISW will publish low-confidence assessments if its analysts judge the issue being assessed to be sufficiently important, timely, or risky to warrant a flag even as ISW continues to evaluate new information.</li>
<li>ISW innovates new ways of collecting, analyzing, and visualizing public data. ISW established a new geospatial program to scale its mapping effort after the Russian invasion and to drive mapping innovation, which was generously enabled by the Dr. Jack London Geospatial Fund.</li>
</ul><p>ISW is committed to providing accurate, granular, and timely intelligence from open sources on threats to US national security interests, including Russia’s brutal invasion of Ukraine. The purpose of ISW’s work is to inform US and allied decision-makers and to educate public audiences regarding these threats. ISW products help to visualize and explain fast-moving conflicts as well as to interpret their trajectory and significance.<strong> ISW’s publication series on the war in Ukraine is an exemplar of ISW’s institutional values and methodology. As such, it is a useful means of understanding ISW’s approach to intelligence analysis.</strong></p>
<p>ISW applies industry-leading tradecraft. ISW’s analytic program trains and applies intelligence methodology that emphasizes source evaluation and characterization, structured analytical techniques, and other foundational principles. Retired members of the intelligence community have informed this tradecraft over many years and ISW welcomes engagement with current intelligence experts regarding ISW’s methodologies. ISW extends this tradecraft into its written product. ISW uses military and intelligence technical language and concepts with precision not only to communicate within a framework that US and allied governments can easily interpret but also, more importantly, to maintain the rigor and discipline of ISW’s analysis even in external communication.</p>
<p><strong>Independence and transparency are core ISW values and are applied to all ISW products.</strong> ISW accepts no US or foreign government money and uses no classified material from any source to produce our analysis. ISW’s independence is a critical enabler of its objectivity. ISW also aims to demonstrate what is possible to achieve in the public domain through the careful application of rigorous tradecraft, even though it is often more difficult than alternative methods. The proven utility of ISW’s products to US and allied governments demonstrates the value of ISW’s approach. ISW’s analytic program is attractive to both aspiring and former members of the intelligence community for this reason.</p>
<p><strong>ISW’s commitment to informing audiences – not convincing them – is demonstrated by ISW’s extensive sharing of its sourcing.</strong> ISW makes available extensive footnotes detailing the evidence used to inform each assessment and has done so for Ukraine since Russia’s current invasion began in February 2022. The investment in this level of evidence-sharing reflects ISW’s commitment to ensuring that readers can form their own judgments on the basis of the evidence and ISW’s reasoning and do not need to take ISW’s word for anything. ISW also analyzes the various information operations directed at and interacting with the war in Ukraine and makes its sourcing available to provide transparency into ISW’s own conclusions.</p>
<p><strong>ISW is not a news organization, however.</strong> <strong>ISW products do not simply report facts but rather <span style="text-decoration: underline;">interpret</span> available data to form assessments regarding what is occurring, has occurred, and could occur and the implications.</strong> Understanding the distinction between fact and assessment is critical for responsibly using ISW products. Assessments can be wrong. In fact, if an analyst is never wrong it is typically a sign that the analyst is doing more reporting than assessing. ISW analysts make calls about what they are seeing and its significance on the basis of data which is invariably incomplete and often contradictory. That data includes but is not limited to the data layers behind ISW’s Ukraine map. ISW analysts also form and continually revise strategic assessments of key actors’ intent, decision-making, capacity, and other factors. This holistic approach is intensive and comprises an analytic backend that is less visible than ISW’s maps but no less vital. ISW’s assessments are sometimes wrong, of course. Whenever ISW concludes that it has made a mistake it publishes a formal correction.</p>
<p>Moreover, analytically sound mapping of war itself requires more than mere data aggregation, as maps are also analytic judgments in visual form. More information on ISW’s mapping methodology is available <a href="https://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/Cartographical%20Methodology%20Explanation%20ISW%20CTP%202022.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>ISW explicitly states its specific confidence level whenever applicable and encourages our readers to include it when reporting our assessments in order to minimize the risk of misinterpretation.</strong> ISW does not refrain from publishing low-confidence assessments, which often distinguishes ISW from other organizations. Instead, ISW will publish at low confidence if its analysts judge the issue being assessed to be sufficiently important, timely, or risky to warrant a flag, which ISW then caveats as necessary and then re-evaluates as new information emerges. This practice enables early warning that provides a valuable means of scoping the aperture of decision-makers even as the situation develops. It is particularly important amidst highly contested information environments like the one in Ukraine.</p>
<p>ISW’s diligence in performing daily analysis of the available data regarding the war in Ukraine is a powerful enabler of ISW’s accuracy. ISW’s teams maintain a constant stare at not only the battlespace but also the information environment. This approach often enables analysts to make relatively fast judgments of new information based on the established patterns ISW monitors closely. It also enables rapid detection of change, anomalies, and inflections which is a key marker of ISW’s unique success in understanding and explaining the war in Ukraine and other conflicts. It has been a critical enabler of ISW’s forecasting accuracy for many years. For example, ISW <a href="https://www.iswresearch.org/2013/11/further-indications-of-al-qaedas.html">warned</a> that ISIS would attempt to seize territorial control in Iraq and that Mosul was vulnerable seven months before ISIS launched its blitz offensive in June 2014. </p>
<p><strong>ISW has applied this proven methodology for analyzing conflicts for over 15 years.</strong> ISW products, including detailed maps, have consistently been utilized by decision-makers and news organizations covering fast-moving and complex national security challenges because of their accuracy and consistency. ISW’s maps of ISIS control in Iraq and Syria provided the leading source of insight and visualization of the war against ISIS after Mosul’s fall and were broadcast widely by international media organizations and leveraged <a href="https://twitter.com/CENTCOM/status/852957314990649345?lang=en">directly</a> by US Central Command in public communications to explain the status of the fight. ISW has extensively mapped the war in Syria, produced detailed maps of the war in Afghanistan at key stages, and has mapped the fight in Ukraine in various ways since the Russians first invaded in 2014. </p>
<p><strong>ISW continues to innovate new ways of collecting, analyzing, and visualizing public data in order to answer intelligence questions that provide US and allied decision-makers with timely and reliable information.</strong> New social media platforms, commercially available data, censorship and disinformation efforts, automation tools and other software all pose new and interesting analytic challenges and opportunities for studying conflict. ISW routinely grapples with these and other opportunities to enhance our tradecraft and reach new insight.</p>
<p><strong>ISW scaled up its mapping effort to meet the demands posed by the Ukraine war in 2022 and established a new geospatial program at ISW, generously enabled by the Dr. Jack London Geospatial Fund.</strong> ISW’s Geospatial team is now a discrete entity that works in support of ISW’s analytic team, providing granular tracking and visualization of the war that informs the assessments ISW analysts produce. This configuration – a mapping team in support of an analytic team – represents a consolidation of ISW’s traditional approach to analyzing conflicts and will enable ISW to continue to achieve greater scale by applying this tradecraft to new portfolios, including China. It also enables ISW’s ongoing innovation of new mapping approaches.</p>
<p>ISW is extraordinarily proud of what its dedicated team has achieved in covering the war in Ukraine for over 430 days. ISW remains grateful to every reader as well as to our generous supporters who enable our work. We also appreciate the hard work of the many other responsible organizations and experts who are adding important insights to the public debate and discussion. ISW’s teams are available, as ever, for inquiries into ISW’s methodology or regarding its products and can be reached via <a href="mailto:press@understandingwar.org">press@understandingwar.org</a>. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Key Takeaway:</em></strong><em> ISIS has orchestrated an annual campaign of intensified attacks around the Islamic holy month of Ramadan since 2012, first in Iraq and then globally. It has sustained this recurring surge in its global operations every year despite its concurrent territorial losses in Iraq and Syria. ISIS’s latest Ramadan campaign began in late April 2019, two weeks before the start of Ramadan on May 5. ISIS has thus far declared a new province in Central Africa, conducted a devastating attack in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday, and launched rare attacks in Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh. ISIS Emir Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi also released his first video statement since his declaration of the Caliphate in 2014, emphasizing his survival, foreshadowing upcoming campaigns, and shaping the future trajectory of ISIS. ISIS is likely to continue demonstrating its global reach by conducting additional major attacks during this upcoming Ramadan in order to offset its loss of core terrain and maintain its image as the world’s deadliest terror organization.</em></p>

Russia gave Turkey permission to fly air sorties into Northern Syria as part of an agreement for <a href="https://www.dailysabah.com/war-on-terror/2019/03/08/turkey-russia-patrols-in-syrias-idlib-will-be-important-step-for-lasting-ceasefire-minister-says">joint military patrols</a> along the frontlines in Greater Idlib Province. The Turkish Armed Forces <a href="https://www.trthaber.com/haber/turkiye/tel-tokanda-turk-askerine-sevgi-gosterisi-407747.html">began</a> joint frontline patrols with pro-regime forces on March 8 with accompanying <a href="file://C:/Users/Kozak/Downloads/Enab%20Baladi">overflights</a> by the Turkish Air Force. The Turkish-Russian agreement in Idlib Province demonstrates that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is failing in his attempts to spoil the de-escalation zone in Northern Syria brokered by Russia, Iran, and Turkey in 2017. Turkey will likely soon begin independent joint patrols with the Russian Armed Forces. Turkey and Russia <a href="https://www.enabbaladi.net/archives/282027">began</a> joint patrols of a separate area near Tel Rifaat north of Aleppo City on February 14. Turkey’s deepening relationship with Russia in Syria decreases the likelihood that the U.S. will reach a negotiated <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-gives-european-allies-friday-deadline-to-sign-on-to-syria-proposal-11551995825">agreement</a> with Turkey over the status of <a href="http://iswresearch.blogspot.com/2019/03/disposition-of-adversary-and-friendly.html">Eastern Syria</a>. Russia intends to use its engagement with Turkey in Western Syria to set conditions to cooperate with Turkey against the U.S.-Led Coalition and its partnered Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) in Eastern Syria.  ISW is closely following the evolving situation in Idlib Province and will provide further updates as necessary.</p>

These actors nonetheless still have options that could lead to the defeat or expulsion of U.S. forces. The residual U.S. forces will operate at Al-Tanf on the Syrian-Jordanian Border as well as in Northern and Eastern Syria across the Euphrates River. The garrison at Al-Tanf is relatively defensible with secure supply lines to Jordan as well as a limited tactical requirement to defend the base and a surrounding fifty-five kilometer exclusion zone, which includes the Rukban IDP Camp. The U.S. is significantly more vulnerable east of the Euphrates River. Iran, Assad, and Russia are building up forces west of the Euphrates River and using outreach to local tribes to gain footholds on its eastern bank. Even a limited drawdown by the U.S. will create security gaps east of the Euphrates River that could be exploited by Iran, Assad, and Russia.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em>Map Methodology: </em></strong>This graphic depicts the disposition of both adversary and partnered forces deployed at key infrastructure locations and urban centers in Eastern Syria and Western Iraq. Position locations are based on information available in open sources reviewed by the Institute for the Study of War (ISW). The list of locations and forces depicted on this graphic is not exhaustive but rather meant to show the presence of forces at assessed locations of vital strategic value or likely escalation. It also does not provide an assessment of the size of the deployed forces or their integration into wider command-and-control structures. The graphic does not depict the specific deployment locations of U.S.-Led Anti-ISIS Coalition forces beyond the garrison at Al-Tanf.  ISW will continue to update this dataset and publish updates as necessary. U.S. and allied government readers may contact ISW to request more details on the specific units and forces represented generally on this graphic.</p>

<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><span style="font-size: 13.008px;">ISIS’s post-Caliphate insurgency in Iraq is accelerating faster than efforts to prevent it by the U.S. Anti-ISIS Coalition. ISIS is re-establishing capable insurgent networks in multiple historical strongholds and linking them together, setting the conditions for future offensive operations against the Government of Iraq. The U.S. and its partners should not view the current relative security in Baghdad as confirmation of the defeat of ISIS. The U.S. Anti-ISIS Coalition’s strategy to enable Iraq to “independently manage” an insurgency through intelligence support and other building partner capacity efforts will likely fail to prevent ISIS from regaining momentum based on its current trajectory in Iraq.</span></p>

Title    : Russia in Review: Russia's Influence Grows After Moldovan Elections
Published: Wed, 06 Mar 2019 05:00:00 +0000
Summary  :
<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p><img src="https://files.constantcontact.com/c9ccf499301/d7f25d44-7d67-446d-8201-7553a9322dcd.png" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Kremlin is successfully increasing its political influence in Moldova. The pro-Kremlin Party of Socialists of the Republic of Moldova (PRSM) won the largest share in the February 24 Moldovan Parliamentary Elections. However, Moldova will likely be forced to call new elections within the next forty-five days due to continued deadlock in government-formation negotiations. Russia will likely bolster its disinformation campaign over the next six weeks in order to set conditions ahead of a new vote. Pro-Kremlin Moldovan President Igor Dodon will also likely continue to shape the information space and stress the need for a strategic alliance with Russia rather than the EU in order to ensure a decisive victory for his PSRM. The U.S. should engage diplomatically and work with favorable political parties in order to counter Russia’s agenda in Moldova.</p>

Title    : Navigating the U.S.-Turkey Relationship Beyond the Quagmire
Published: Wed, 25 Jul 2018 04:00:00 +0000
Summary  :
<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden"><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even"><p align="center" style="text-align: justify;"><strong style="font-size: 13.008px;"><em>Key Takeaway</em></strong><em style="font-size: 13.008px;">: The U.S. needs Turkey as an active partner despite its slide into authoritarianism under Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The U.S. should adopt an interest-based approach towards Turkey that shapes its behavior in line with shared strategic objectives such as reversing the gains of Iran and Russia in the Middle East.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The U.S. needs Turkey to contribute actively as an ally in NATO. </strong>The U.S. and NATO face an <a href="http://iswresearch.blogspot.com/2018/07/hungary-risks-nato-unity-on-ukraine.html">increasingly</a> <a href="http://iswresearch.blogspot.com/2018/07/putin-poised-for-easy-victory-ahead-of.html">aggressive</a> Russia in the Middle East and Europe.<strong> </strong>Turkey plays an integral role in countering this threat. It dominates the Turkish Straits connecting the Black Sea to the Eastern Mediterranean. It provides a strategically-positioned platform on the southern flank of NATO from which to exert influence in the Middle East and Black Sea. It also maintains the second-largest available combat force in NATO. The U.S. and NATO already operate a number of critical military installations across Turkey including Incirlik Airbase.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Turkey is nonetheless the largest vulnerability to NATO’s cohesion.</strong> Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan <a href="http://iswresearch.blogspot.com/2018/06/the-collapse-of-turkeys-democracy.html">cemented</a> his own authoritarian rule in the 2018 Turkish General Elections. His new regime is pursuing self-serving policies that undermine the U.S. and NATO. Erdogan is <a href="https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/04/trump-syria-withdrawal-iran-turkey-russia.html">willing to align</a> with Russia and Iran against the U.S. Anti-ISIS Coalition. He has repeatedly fueled <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-europe-migrants-eu/eu-summit-to-focus-on-lowering-mediterranean-immigration-idUSKBN1JL2PJ">diplomatic rifts</a> with the U.S. and EU. He has conducted <a href="http://iswresearch.blogspot.com/2018/01/syrias-war-after-isis-begins-as-turkey.html">military operations</a> <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/flashpoints/2018/03/05/pentagon-operations-against-isis-in-eastern-syria-paused/">targeting</a> the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) - the principal ground partner of the U.S. Anti-ISIS Coalition in Syria. His <a href="http://iswresearch.blogspot.com/2018/03/turkey-threatens-new-attacks-in-syria.html">interventions</a> (and <em>de facto</em> territorial annexations) in Iraq and Syria undermine the ability of the U.S. and NATO to credibly condemn similar acts of aggression by Russia.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The U.S. should commit to a smarter interest-based approach that compels greater cooperation from Turkey. </strong>The U.S. and Turkey are mired in tactical negotiations that fail to address their wider <a href="http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/PLANEX%20Report%202%20FINALFINAL.pdf">strategic divergences</a> or repair the damage from years of <a href="http://iswresearch.blogspot.com/2017/11/turkeys-silent-al-qaeda-partner-in-syria.html">opposing</a> <a href="http://iswresearch.blogspot.com/2017/05/turkey-divide.html">policy</a> <a href="http://www.understandingwar.org/sites/default/files/The%20Pitfalls%20of%20Relying%20on%20Kurdish%20Forces%20to%20Counter%20ISIS.pdf">choices</a> in Iraq and Syria. The Trump Administration has engaged to resolve discrete challenges with Turkey such as the status of the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/04/world/middleeast/turkey-syria-kurds-manbij.html">contested town</a> of Manbij in Northern Syria and the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-works-to-ease-tensions-with-turkey-to-secure-pastors-release-1522852192">arbitrary detention</a> of U.S. Pastor Andrew Brunson. These talks are insufficient to mend the relationship absent a more fundamental realignment between the U.S. and Turkey. The U.S. must refocus on areas of shared interest with Turkey following the reelection of an emboldened Erdogan.</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;"><li><em style="font-size: 13.008px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Counter-Terrorism</span></em><em style="font-size: 13.008px;">:</em><span style="font-size: 13.008px;"> The U.S. and Turkey can find common ground against designated terrorist groups such as ISIS, al Qaeda, and the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK).

The U.S. should also actively limit the influence of the PKK-linked Syrian Kurdish YPG within the SDF. These reforms are independently valuable as a means to address grievances among local Sunni Arabs that could fuel a renewed insurgency against the U.S. Anti-ISIS Coalition. Turkey must in turn cease its </span><a href="http://iswresearch.blogspot.com/2018/02/the-al-qaeda-blind-spot-for-us-approach.html" style="font-size: 13.008px;">cooperation</a><span style="font-size: 13.008px;"> with al Qaeda in Syria and instead engage actively in counter-terrorism operations against al Qaeda and other </span><a href="https://www.criticalthreats.org/analysis/americas-real-enemy-the-salafi-jihadi-movement" style="font-size: 13.008px;">Salafi-Jihadist Groups</a><span style="font-size: 13.008px;">.

Turkey must freeze its </span><a href="" style="font-size: 13.008px;">purchase</a><span style="font-size: 13.008px;"> of the Russian S-400 Surface-to-Air Missile System.

</ul><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The U.S. can manage its relationship with Turkey without capitulating to Erdogan. </strong>The U.S. and Turkey both need one another to confront their mutual adversaries in the Middle East and Europe. This fact remains true despite the unacceptable growth of authoritarianism under Erdogan. There is no quick policy fix to resolve the tensions between the U.S. and Turkey. The U.S. could nonetheless use an incremental and interest-based approach focused on clear areas of strategic convergence in order to protect its long-term alliance with a post-Erdogan Turkey.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><strong><em><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;" xml:lang="EN">Key Takeaway:</span></em></strong><strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;" xml:lang="EN"> The U.S. and Afghanistan have an opportunity to advance their strategic goal of negotiating an acceptable settlement with the Taliban, but not all Taliban members are reconcilable. </span></strong><span lang="EN" style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 115%;" xml:lang="EN">The Taliban faces a potential rift between its leadership and rank-and-file militants in Afghanistan that threatens the Taliban’s cohesion. Large numbers of rank-and-file militants expressed their support for peace during unprecedented joint celebrations alongside Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) during a nationwide ceasefire for Eid al-Fitr on June 15 - 17. The ceasefire’s events exposed rifts amongst Taliban leadership concerning reconciliation. The U.S. and the Government of Afghanistan could exploit these apparent rifts in order to advance their strategic goal of a negotiated settlement with the Taliban. The new momentum towards peace could nonetheless generate additional pressure for the withdrawal of the U.S. from Afghanistan amidst the scheduled 2018 Afghan Parliamentary Elections.<strong> </strong>ISIS - Wilayat Khorasan could also exploit these rifts in to bolster its recruitment of hardline Taliban militants and expand its operations in Afghanistan.</span></p>

<p>A top official in the Department of Labor this week informed all staff members that they could face criminal charges if they speak to journalists, former employees or others about agency business.</p>

<p>A memo sent Monday by Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer’s chief of staff, Jihun Han, and obtained by ProPublica, states that “individuals who disclose confidential information or engage in unauthorized communications with the media may face serious legal consequences.”</p>

<p>Among the ramifications, the memo states, are “potential criminal penalties, depending on the nature of the information and the applicable laws,” and “immediate disciplinary actions, up to and including termination.”</p>

<p>The guidance document went on to say that “any unauthorized communication with the media,” regardless of what information is shared or how it is shared, “will be treated as a serious offense.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p>The memo listed laws, regulations and a departmental guide to explain its legal position. Among them was a regulation concerning civil servants’ ethical obligations and a law, the Freedom of Information Act, guaranteeing the public the right to inspect certain public records.</p>

<p>“This message will serve as your only warning,” the memo stated.</p>

<p>The warning comes as current and former Labor Department employees have spoken to the news media about <a href="https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/5235329-federal-labor-agency-changes/">harms they see resulting from the dismantling of portions of their agency</a>, which enforces laws guaranteeing rights to a safe workplace, fair pay and protections against discrimination.</p>

<p>“It’s very chilling,” a Labor Department employee who requested anonymity for fear of retribution told ProPublica. “It’s never a good look when you’re telling people to never talk about what you’re doing.”</p>

<p>Labor Department spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>“These types of missives can chill the free flow of information to the press and the public,” said Gabe Rottman, vice president of policy at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. “That’s a concern.”</p>

<p>Civil servants do not sacrifice their First Amendment rights by accepting a job with the federal government, but <a href="https://www.acludc.org/en/know-your-rights/federal-employee-speech-first-amendment">there do exist higher restrictions</a> on what information they can disclose publicly. Government agencies that handle classified information have on rare occasions launched criminal investigations against leakers, but those are typically invoked <a href="https://www.rcfp.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/12-8-2019-Leaks-Chart-1.pdf">only when leaks involve</a> classified national security intelligence or protected financial information, Rottman said.</p>

<p>“But normally, disclosures to the press or others would be a matter of employee discipline as opposed to carrying criminal sanctions,” he said.</p>

<p>While the memo raising the possibility of criminal penalties was sent to Labor Department employees, it reflects a common approach by the administration of President Donald Trump to guard against federal government employees speaking to reporters.</p>

<p>Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, for example, <a href="https://newrepublic.com/post/192753/tulsi-gabbard-clamps-down-leaks-media-threat">has publicly announced</a> an aggressive pursuit of leakers. Elon Musk, who launched the Department of Government Efficiency, which is at the heart of the shake-up of the federal government, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/21/elon-musk-leak-hunt-026928">has bragged about</a> his tactics in rooting out leaks at his companies. And Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/22/pete-hegseth-signal-group-chat">has blamed alleged leaks</a> by former Pentagon staffers for reigniting controversy over his use of the Signal messaging app to discuss military operations.</p>

<p>Federal employees at various agencies told ProPublica that an air of suspicion has descended on their workplace during Trump’s second term, with rumors flying of surveillance of rank-and-file government workers. In the Department of Agriculture, for example, a banner temporarily appeared on government computers when employees logged in, telling them that “unauthorized or improper use of this system may result in disciplinary action, as well as civil and criminal penalties.”</p>

<p>Agriculture Department spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>The Labor Department employee told ProPublica that Monday’s memo felt like the latest attack on a workforce already weathering layoffs, spending freezes and reorganizations.</p>

<p>“It’s been horrible. It’s been a deeply exhausting roller coaster,” the employee said. “It’s very difficult to work when you’re in a constant state of being terrorized by your employer.”</p>

Title    : Fentanyl Pipeline: How a Chinese Prison Helped Fuel a Deadly Drug Crisis in the United States

<p>China’s vast security apparatus shrouds itself in shadows, but the outside world has caught periodic glimpses of it behind the faded gray walls of Shijiazhuang prison in the northern province of Hebei.</p>

<p>Chinese media reports have shown inmates hunched over sewing machines in a garment workshop in the sprawling facility. Business leaders and Chinese Communist Party dignitaries have praised the penitentiary for exemplifying President Xi Jinping’s views on the rule of law.</p>

<p>But the prison has an alarming secret, U.S. congressional investigators disclosed last year. They revealed evidence showing that it is a Chinese government outpost in the trafficking pipeline that inundates the United States with fentanyl.</p>

<p>For at least eight years, the prison owned a chemical company called Yafeng, the hub of a group of Chinese firms and websites that sold fentanyl products to Americans, according to the U.S. <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/ZS/ZS00/20240416/117142/HRPT-118-1.pdf#page=21">congressional investigation</a>, as well as Chinese government and <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25881584-c4ads-hebei-shijiazhuang-yafeng-chemical-plant/">corporate records</a> obtained by ProPublica. The company’s English-language websites brazenly offered U.S. customers dangerous drugs that are illegal in both nations. Promising to smuggle illicit chemicals past U.S. and Mexican border defenses, Yafeng boasted to American clients that “100% of our shipments will clear customs.”</p>

<p>Although China tightly restricts the domestic manufacturing, sale and use of fentanyl products, the nation has been the world’s leading producer of fentanyl that enters the United States and remains the leading producer of chemical precursors with which Mexican cartels make the drug. Overdoses on synthetic opioid drugs, most of them fentanyl related, have killed over 450,000 Americans during the past decade — more than the U.S. deaths in the Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.</p>

<p>The involvement of a state-run prison is just one sign of the Chinese government’s role in fomenting the U.S. fentanyl crisis, U.S. investigators say. Chinese leaders have insistently denied such allegations. But U.S. national security officials said the Yafeng case shows how China allows its chemical industry to engage openly in sales to overseas customers while blocking online domestic access and enforcing stern laws against drug dealing inside the country. Beijing also encourages the manufacture and export of fentanyl products, including drugs outlawed in China, with generous financial incentives, according to a bipartisan inquiry last year by the House Select Committee on Strategic Competition between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party.</p>

<p>“So the Chinese government pays you to send drugs to America but executes you for selling them in China,” Matt Cronin, a former federal prosecutor who led the House inquiry, said in an interview. “It’s impossible that the Chinese Communist Party doesn’t know what’s going on and can’t do anything about it.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p>China’s antidrug cooperation has been persistently poor, U.S. officials said. In 2019, Xi imposed controls that cut the export of fentanyl, but Chinese sellers shifted to shipping precursors to Mexico, where the cartels expanded their production.</p>

<p>“We couldn’t get the Chinese on the phone to talk about fighting child pornography, let alone fentanyl,’’ said Jacob Braun, who served as a senior official at the Department of Homeland Security during the Biden administration. “There was zero cooperation.”</p>

<p>China also remains the base of <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/how-beijing-chinese-mafia-europe-protect-interests">global organized crime groups</a> that launder billions for fentanyl traffickers in the U.S, Mexico and <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/8122106/canada-needs-u-s-style-racketeering-laws-current-organized-crime-laws-failing-b-c-ag-tells-feds/">Canada</a>. <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/china-cartels-xizhi-li-money-laundering">ProPublica has previously reported</a> that this underground banking system depends on the <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/liu-tao-trump-meeting-china-investigation">Chinese elite</a>, who move fortunes abroad by acquiring drug cash from Chinese criminal brokers for Mexican cartels. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-icbc-spain-investigation/fines-short-jail-terms-for-four-ex-icbc-spain-employees-in-laundering-case-idUSKBN23N2Q6/">Chinese banks</a> and businesses also help hide the origin of illicit proceeds. The regime in Beijing therefore has considerable control over key nodes in the fentanyl chain: raw materials, production, sales and money laundering.</p>

<p>U.S. leaders, <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DgVlTMqQPF04&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1744036544050687&amp;usg=AOvVaw1FPSqrIFDP2O3cfZig2gNA">Democrats</a> and <a href="https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/Written%20Testimony%20-%20The%20Honorable%20Bill%20Barr.pdf">Republicans</a> alike, have accused China of using fentanyl to weaken the United States. Some veteran agents agree.</p>

<p>Ray Donovan, who retired in 2023 as the Drug Enforcement Administration’s chief of operations, said he believes that a “deliberate strategy” by the Chinese state has caused the trafficking onslaught “to grow in size and scope.”</p>

<p>“They have said for years that they are cracking down,” Donovan said in an interview. “But we haven’t seen meaningful action.”</p>

<p>Still, current and former U.S. officials told ProPublica that the national security community has not found conclusive evidence of a planned, high-level campaign against Americans by the Chinese government. That is partly because for years the U.S. treated fentanyl as a law enforcement matter rather than a national security threat, making it hard to gather intelligence about the extent and nature of the regime’s role.</p>

<p>“If this was Chinese intelligence doing something, we have a focus on that as counterintelligence,” said Alan Kohler, who retired from the FBI in 2023 after serving as director of the counterintelligence division. “If it was drug cartels, we have a criminal focus on that. But this area of crime and state converging falls between the seams in and among agencies.”</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the current and former officials said rampant fentanyl trafficking could not continue without at least the passive complicity of the world’s most powerful police state.</p>

<p>“I haven’t seen smoking-gun evidence that it’s a policy or strategy of the government at a high level,” Kohler said. “You could argue that their decision not to do anything about it, even after the results are clear, is tacit support.”</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p>In a written statement, the spokesperson for China’s embassy in Washington described as “totally groundless” any allegation that the regime has fomented the crisis.</p>

<p>“The fentanyl issue is the U.S.’s own problem,” said the spokesperson, Liu Pengyu. “China has given support to the U.S.’s response to the fentanyl issue in the spirit of humanity.” At the United States’ request, he said, China in 2019 restricted “fentanyl-related substances as a class,” becoming the first country to do so, and has cooperated with the U.S. on counternarcotics.</p>

<p>“The remarkable progress is there for all to see.”</p>

<p>The Trump administration has made the fight against fentanyl a priority and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-imposes-tariffs-on-imports-from-canada-mexico-and-china/">in February</a> imposed a 25% tariff on Chinese imports to pressure Beijing for results. The approach could put a dent in the drug trade, but it’s too early to tell, officials said.</p>

<p>“The Chinese system responds to a negative incentive,” said former FBI agent Holden Triplett, who served as legal attache in Beijing and director of counterintelligence on the National Security Council. “China may be willing to endure more pain than we can give. But it is our only chance.”</p>

<p>To respond effectively, the U.S. needs a clearer picture of the Chinese fentanyl underworld, Triplett and others say. The activities of the Shijiazhuang prison are a compelling case study, but not the only one.</p>

<p>To examine the role of the Chinese state in the drug trade, ProPublica interviewed more than three dozen current and former national security officials for the U.S. and other countries, some of whom provided exclusive inside accounts. The reporting also drew on last year’s House investigation, digging into significant findings that have received little public attention, plus court files, government documents, academic studies, private inquiries and public records in the U.S., China and Mexico.</p>

Prison Business
<p>In 2010, the Hebei Prison Administration Bureau combined three detention facilities to create a high-security prison in Shijiazhuang, the capital of Hebei province. The region is a base of China’s chemical industry, which is the largest in the world. It is also weakly regulated and freewheeling, according to U.S. national security officials, private studies and other sources. A shifting array of companies peddle everything from innocuous fertilizers to deadly opioids.</p>

<p>Liu Jianhua, a veteran Chinese Communist Party official with a master’s degree in business administration from the University of Illinois Chicago, became director of the prison in 2014. By then, fentanyl was cutting a swath across America. Overdose deaths soared due to the ease with which U.S. users and dealers could acquire fentanyl products by mail from China.</p>

<p>China’s high-tech surveillance apparatus aggressively polices the online activities of its citizens. Yet sales of fentanyl to foreigners have thrived on popular, easily accessible websites, said Frank Montoya Jr., a former FBI agent with years of China-related experience who served as a top U.S. counterintelligence official.</p>

<p>“You don’t have to go on the dark web,” Montoya said. “It is out in the open.”</p>

<p>Yafeng Biological Technology Co. Ltd., also known as Hebei Shijiazhuang Yafeng Chemical Plant, became a typical player on this frontier, the congressional inquiry found. (As part of its reporting, ProPublica mapped links between the prison, the company and the U.S. drug market with the help of two entities that specialize in China open-source research: Sayari, a company that provides risk management and supply-chain analysis and that supported the House inquiry, and C4ADS, a nonprofit that investigates illicit global networks.)</p>

<p>Yafeng’s <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240225091201if_/http:/www.chinayfkj.com/EN/news/danye.asp?id=1">websites</a> and <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25881584-c4ads-hebei-shijiazhuang-yafeng-chemical-plant/">Chinese corporate records</a> describe the firm as a chemical manufacturer. It has ties through other websites, phone numbers and email addresses to at least nine companies that advertised illicit drugs, causing investigators to conclude that Yafeng was a network hub, according to the report and interviews. It’s common for interconnected Chinese fentanyl producers and brokers to obscure details about their enterprises and change names and platforms to elude detection, U.S. officials said.</p>

<p>In some ways, Yafeng presented itself to foreign buyers as a respectable company. The English-language websites featured peppy phrases like “team spirit” and “promoting the well-being of community.” The China-based sales representatives gave themselves Western names: Diana, Monica, Jessica. A map of markets showed shipping routes from China to the United States, Mexico, Canada and other countries.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            A map on Yafeng’s website showed its distribution and a list of available drugs to purchase.

<p>Yet the sales pitches left little doubt that the firm knew its activities were illegal. Yafeng websites utilized familiar terms assuring U.S. and Mexican drug users and traffickers of the company’s skill at smuggling illegal narcotics overseas, according to the House report and U.S. investigators. The company touted its use of “hidden food bags,” a method in which drugs are concealed in shipments labeled as food products. Ads promised “strong safety delivery to Mexico, USA” with “packaging made to measure” to “guarantee” that illicit chemicals would elude border inspections, documents show.</p>

<p>Chinese traffickers often discuss lawbreaking in such brazen terms with foreign customers, seemingly unconcerned about China’s omnipresent surveillance system, court files and interviews show. Another firm, Hubei Amarvel Biotech, explicitly explained to U.S. and Mexican clients online — complete with photos — its methods for “100% stealth shipping” of drugs disguised as nuts, dog food and motor oil, <a href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-06/sdny_unsealed_2023.06.22_amarvel_biotech_indictment_stamped_redacted.pdf">court documents</a> say. After undercover DEA agents lured two Amarvel executives to Fiji and arrested them, a New York jury <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/two-chinese-chemical-company-executives-convicted-and-multiple-websites-and-0">convicted them</a> in February on charges of importation of fentanyl precursors and money laundering. (One defendant, Yiyi Chen, has filed a motion requesting an acquittal or retrial.)</p>

<p>At the time of the arrests, the Chinese government issued a statement condemning the U.S. prosecution as “a typical example of arbitrary detention and unilateral sanctions.”</p>

<p>Similarly, Yafeng websites displayed photos of narcotics in plastic baggies to peddle a long list of chemicals, including fentanyl precursors and U-47700, a powerful fentanyl analogue outlawed in both the U.S. and China that has no medical use, the House report says.</p>

<p>One victim of U-47700 was Garrett Holman of Lynchburg, Virginia. Holman had fallen in with youths who discovered how easy it was to buy synthetic drugs online. In late 2016, Holman overdosed on U-47700, street name “pinky,” that arrived by mail from southern China. His father, Don, performed CPR before paramedics rushed Holman to the hospital. Although he survived, another overdose killed him just days before his 21st birthday in February 2017.</p>

<p>“My son’s opioid exposure was less than two months,” Don Holman told <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/FA/FA16/20180906/108650/HHRG-115-FA16-Transcript-20180906.pdf#page=100">a hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee</a> the next year. “At 20 years old, I do not believe my son deserved to die for his initial bad choices.”</p>

<p>The father handed over evidence, including the envelope in which the drugs arrived, to federal agents, who traced about 20 shipments back to the same sender in China, he said in an interview. Don Holman blames the fentanyl crisis on the American appetite for opioids as well as the Chinese government. He has spent eight years telling anyone he can, from drug czars to fellow parents, about the experience that shattered his family.</p>

<p>“I’ve had to hit parents right between the eyes, like: ‘Hey, your child is not going to be here if you don’t do something,” he said. “You need to wake up.’”</p>

<p>No link to Yafeng surfaced in that case. The firm’s sales of U-47700 and other illicit drugs occurred during a period when its sole owner and controlling shareholder was the Shijiazhuang prison, according to the House inquiry, Sayari and C4ADS.</p>

<p>One of Yafeng’s street addresses was that of the prison, ProPublica determined through satellite photos and public records. Another Yafeng address next door also houses the offices of a clothing firm owned by the provincial prison administration. A third Yafeng address a few blocks away is a former municipal police station, records and photos show.</p>

<p>The director of the prison, Liu Jianhua, left his post after becoming the target of a corruption inquiry in 2021, according to Chinese media reports. It’s unknown how that investigation was resolved or if his fall had anything to do with the drug activity. Liu could not be reached for comment. The prison administration did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Yafeng stopped doing business under that name at some point between 2018 and 2022, records show. Yet the Yafeng group continued to function through at least one of its affiliated websites, protonitazene.com, the congressional report said. As of last year, the site was still advertising “hot sale to Mexico” of drugs including nitazenes, which are 25 times more powerful than fentanyl.</p>

Government Incentives
<p>Yafeng is not the only company with connections to the Chinese state and fentanyl.</p>

<p>Gaosheng Biotechnology in Shanghai is “wholly state-owned,” congressional investigators found. The company sold fentanyl precursors and other narcotics — some illegal in China — on 98 websites to U.S., Mexican and European customers, <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/ZS/ZS00/20240416/117142/HRPT-118-1.pdf#page=20">the report says</a>. Senior provincial development officials visited Gaosheng and praised its benefits for the regional economy. Gaosheng did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>The Chinese government owned a stake in <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/ZS/ZS00/20240416/117142/HRPT-118-1.pdf#page=23">Zhejiang Netsun</a>, a private firm that had a Chinese Communist Party member serving on its board of directors as a deputy general manager, the congressional report says. Netsun carried out over 400 sales of illegal narcotics, the report says, and served as a billing or technical contact for over 100 similar companies — including Yafeng. Netsun did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>And the Shanghai government gave monetary awards and export credits to Shanghai Ruizheng Chemical Technology Co., a “notorious seller of fentanyl products, which it advertises widely and openly on Chinese websites like Alibaba,” <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/ZS/ZS00/20240416/117142/HRPT-118-1.pdf#page=20">the report says</a>. Chinese officials invited company reps to roundtable discussions about technology and business. Shanghai Ruizheng did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p>Chinese government officials who interact with the trafficking underworld are often prominent in provincial governments, where corruption is widespread, said a former senior DEA official, Donald Im, who led investigations focused on China. Not only can they make money through kickbacks or investments, but they benefit politically, rising in the Communist Party hierarchy if their local chemical industries prosper.</p>

<p>“Key government officials know about the fentanyl trade and they let it happen,” Im said.</p>

<p>China’s central government also plays a vital role by providing systemic financial incentives that fuel fentanyl trafficking to the Americas, U.S. officials say. The House inquiry <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/ZS/ZS00/20240416/117142/HRPT-118-1.pdf#page=11">discovered a national Value-Added Tax rebate program</a> that has spurred exports of at least 17 illegal narcotics with no legitimate purpose. They include a fentanyl product that is “up to 6,000 times stronger than morphine,” the House report says.</p>

<p>This state subsidy program has pumped billions of dollars into the export of fentanyl products, including ones outlawed in China, according to the report and U.S. officials. The tax rebate is 13%, the highest available rate. To qualify, companies have to document the names and quantities of chemicals and other details of transactions, the report says.</p>

<p>The existence of this paper trail refutes a frequent claim by Chinese leaders: that weak regulation of the chemical sector makes it impossible to identify and punish suspects.</p>

<p>Chinese officials did not respond to specific questions about the government financial incentives or the state-connected companies involved in drug trafficking. But the embassy spokesperson said China has targeted online sellers with a “national internet cleanup campaign.”</p>

<p>During that crackdown, Liu Pengyu said, Chinese authorities have cleaned “14 online platforms, canceled over 330 company accounts, shut down over 1,000 online shops, removed over 152,000 online advertisements, and closed 10 botnet websites.” He said Chinese law enforcement has determined that many illegal ads appear on foreign online platforms.</p>

Wall of Resistance
<p>In May 2018, Cronin — then a federal prosecutor based in Cleveland — went to Beijing in pursuit of one of the biggest targets in the grim history of the fentanyl crisis: the Zheng drug trafficking organization, an international empire accused of trafficking in 37 U.S. states.</p>

<p>Cronin and his team of agents hoped to persuade Chinese authorities to prosecute <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkyLQEnFggE">Guanghua and Fujing Zheng</a>, a father and son who were the top suspects. They ran into a wall of resistance.</p>

<p>In an interview, Cronin recalled walking into a cavernous room in China’s Ministry of Public Security where a row of senior officials and uniformed police waited at a long table. A curtain-sized Chinese flag covered a wall.</p>

<p>Cronin took a breath, opened a stack of binders he had lugged from Cleveland and presented his case. The prosecutor laid out evidence connecting the Zhengs, who were chemical company executives based in Shanghai, to two overdoses in Ohio. The U.S. distribution hub was a warehouse near Boston run by a Chinese chemist, Bin Wang. Later, Wang said he simultaneously worked for the Chinese government “tracking chemicals produced in China” and traveled home monthly from Boston “to consult with Chinese officials,” a memo by his lawyer said.</p>

<p>The response of the Chinese counterdrug chiefs was a brush-off, Cronin recalled in the interview. Essentially, he said, they told him: “You are right that the Zhengs are exporting these drugs that are killing Americans. But unfortunately, technically what they are doing is not a violation of Chinese law.”</p>

<p>Cronin pulled out another binder. He went over evidence and an expert analysis showing that the Zhengs had committed Chinese felonies, including money laundering, manufacturing of counterfeit drugs and mislabeling of packages.</p>

<p>Tensions rose when the Chinese officials responded that, unfortunately, the police unit that handled such offenses was not available; they rebuffed Cronin’s offer to delay his return flight in order to meet with that unit, he said.</p>

<p>After the U.S. Justice Department <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/two-chinese-nationals-charged-operating-global-opioid-and-drug-manufacturing-conspiracy">charged the Zhengs</a> that August with a drug trafficking conspiracy resulting in death, a Chinese newspaper reported that a Chinese senior counterdrug official criticized the case. The U.S. “failed to provide China any evidence to prove Zheng violated Chinese law,” the official said.</p>

<p>Later, the U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned the Zhengs and designated the son as a <a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/media/44656/download?inline">drug kingpin</a>. U.S. investigators told ProPublica they concluded that the Zhengs operated with the blessing of the Chinese government, citing the defendants’ sheer volume of business, high-profile online activity and open communications on WeChat, the Chinese messaging platform that authorities heavily monitor.</p>

<p>Ohio courts granted millions of dollars in civil damages to the family of Thomas Rauh, a 37-year-old who died of an overdose in Akron in 2015. The family never received any money, however.</p>

<p>Rauh’s father, James, who traveled and did business in China in his youth, has become an antidrug activist. He said the U.S. government must do more to crack down on China’s role and counter public stigma that still blames addicts.</p>

<p>“I don’t think the U.S. government wants to take the responsibility for confronting this,” he said.</p>

<p>A decade of frustration has compelled James Rauh to call for a drastic solution. He wants the U.S. to designate fentanyl as a weapon of mass destruction in response to what he sees as an intentional Chinese campaign.</p>

<p>“It’s asymmetric warfare,” he said.</p>

<p>The Zhengs remain free in China and have never responded to the allegations in court. During a brief encounter with a “60 Minutes” journalist in Shanghai in 2019, Guanghua Zheng denied he was still selling fentanyl in the United States and said the Chinese government “has nothing to do with it.” <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndoh/pr/chinese-national-sentenced-nearly-six-years-prison-distributing-opioids-and-other-drugs">Wang</a> pleaded guilty and served prison time.</p>

<p>The Zheng case is typical, said Im, the former senior DEA official. Thousands of DEA leads relayed to Chinese counterparts over the years have been “met with silence,” he said. In other cases, Chinese officials have asked for more details about the targets of U.S. investigations — and then warned suspects linked to the Communist Party, Im said.</p>

<p>Most U.S. national security officials interviewed for this story described similar experiences, citing a few exceptions, such as a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/07/777173066/china-jails-9-in-fentanyl-trafficking-case-that-began-with-a-u-s-tip">joint U.S.-Chinese operation</a> in Hebei province in 2019.</p>

<p>A former DEA agent, William Kinghorn, recalled the dispiriting aftermath of an investigation he oversaw centered on <a href="https://www.state.gov/chuen-fat-yip">Chuen Fat Yip</a>, whose firms allegedly distributed more than $280 million worth of drugs. Yip has denied wrongdoing and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/chinas-suspected-fentanyl-king-claims-hes-being-framed-by-pepsi-coke/">denounced U.S. criminal charges</a> and sanctions. He is on the DEA’s 10 most wanted fugitives list and remains free in China, U.S. officials said.</p>

<p>“We obtained information that the Chinese authorities did ban or shut down the companies” the DEA targeted in the case, Kinghorn said in an interview. “We learned that afterward these same people [linked to Yip] were now owning or managing similar companies. Even though they had been banned, they basically just changed the name of the company.”</p>

<p>A sense of impunity persists in the chemical industry, according to <a href="https://www.elliptic.co/blog/chinese-businesses-fueling-the-fentanyl-epidemic-receive-millions-in-cryptocurrency-payments">a 2023 inquiry</a> by Elliptic, a U.K. analytics firm. It reported that many of the 90 Chinese companies contacted by its undercover researchers were “willing to supply fentanyl itself, despite this being banned in China since 2019.”</p>

<p>The final year of the Biden administration brought signs of modest progress in China, including new regulations, shutdowns of firms, and arrests of a suspected money launderer and four senior chemical company employees charged by U.S. prosecutors.</p>

<p>Citing those cases from 2024, spokesperson Liu Pengyu said China has “collaborated closely” with the U.S., adding, “Multiple major cases are making great progress.”</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p>Meanwhile, U.S. overdose deaths fell by 33% compared with the previous year, according to <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/ATA-2025-Unclassified-Report.pdf#page=5">the annual threat assessment by the U.S. intelligence community</a> released March 25. The drop may be tied to the increased availability of naloxone, a drug for treating overdoses, the report said.</p>

<p>The threat assessment report warned that “China likely will struggle to sufficiently constrain” companies and criminal groups involved in the U.S. fentanyl trade, “absent greater law enforcement actions.”</p>

<p>Cronin, the former federal prosecutor, went on to become chief investigative counsel for the House Select Committee. He led last year’s inquiry into China’s role in the fentanyl crisis. The committee’s review of seven Chinese company websites <a href="https://docs.house.gov/meetings/ZS/ZS00/20240416/117142/HRPT-118-1.pdf#page=28">found over 31,000 instances</a> of firms offering illegal chemicals during a period of about three months in early 2024.</p>

<p>Undercover communications with the firms “revealed an eagerness to engage in clearly illicit drug sales,” the report says, “with no fear of reprisal.”</p>

<p>The clear-cutting across the federal government under President Donald Trump has been dramatic, with mass terminations, the suspension of decades-old programs and the neutering of entire agencies. But this spectacle has obscured a series of moves by the administration that could profoundly harm some of the most vulnerable people in the U.S.: children.  </p>

<p>Consider: The staff of a program that helps millions of poor families keep the electricity on, in part so that babies don’t die from extreme heat or cold, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/02/climate/trump-layoffs-energy-assistance-liheap.html#:~:text=The%20Trump%20administration%20has%20abruptly,their%20heating%20and%20cooling%20bills.">have all been fired</a>. The federal office that oversees the enforcement of child support payments has been hollowed out. Head Start preschools, which teach toddlers their ABCs and feed them healthy meals, will likely be <a href="https://apnews.com/article/head-start-office-closures-hhs-trump-00b1a6b33ef918cb66e59b7ffb07ac13">forced to shut down en masse,</a> some as soon as May 1. And funding for investigating child sexual abuse and internet crimes against children; responding to reports of missing children; and preventing youth violence has been withdrawn indefinitely. </p>

<p>The administration has laid off thousands of workers from coast to coast who had supervised education, child care, child support and child protective services systems, and it has blocked or delayed billions of dollars in funding for things like school meals and school safety. </p>

<p>These stark reductions have been centered in little-known children’s services offices housed within behemoth agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Justice, offices with names like the Children’s Bureau, the Office of Family Assistance and the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. In part because of their obscurity, the slashing has gone relatively overlooked.</p>

<p>“Everyone’s been talking about what the Trump administration and DOGE have been doing, but no one seems to be talking about how, in a lot of ways, it’s been an assault on kids,” said Bruce Lesley, president of advocacy group First Focus on Children. He added that “the one cabinet agency that they’re fully decimating is the kid one,” referring to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-administration/trump-set-sign-executive-order-shuttering-department-education-rcna197191">Trump’s goal of shuttering the Department of Education</a>. Already, some 2,000 staffers there have lost or left their jobs.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>The impact of these cuts will be felt far beyond Washington, rippling out to thousands of state and local agencies serving children nationwide.</p>

<p>The Department of Education, for instance, has rescinded <a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/close-to-3-billion-in-pandemic-funds-in-jeopardy-as-education-department-abruptly-halts-payments/">as much as $3 billion</a> <a href="https://www.chalkbeat.org/2025/03/31/linda-mcmahon-cancels-covid-relief-spending-extensions-for-schools/">in pandemic-recovery funding</a> for schools, which would have been used for everything from tutoring services <a href="https://marylandmatters.org/2025/03/31/maryland-faces-418m-catastrophic-loss-in-pandemic-era-relief-funds/">for Maryland students who’ve fallen behind</a> to making the air safer to breathe and the water safer to drink <a href="https://www.abc12.com/news/education/flint-community-schools-lose-15-6-million-of-unspent-covid-grants/article_586a4f8d-5894-4946-bea8-8cce39fcfd4d.html">for students in Flint, Michigan</a>. The Department of Agriculture, meanwhile, has <a href="https://stateline.org/2025/04/04/usda-cuts-hit-small-farms-as-trump-showers-billions-on-big-farms/">canceled</a> $660 million in promised grants to farm-to-school programs, which had been providing fresh meat and produce to school cafeterias while supporting small farmers. </p>

<p>At the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the agency’s secretary, has dismissed all of the staff that had distributed $1.7 billion annually in Social Services Block Grant money, which many states have long depended on to be able to run their child welfare, foster care and adoption systems, including birth family visitation, caseworker training and more. The grants also fund day care, counseling and disability services for kids. (It is unclear whether anyone remains at HHS who would know how to get all of that funding out the door or whether it will now be administered by White House appointees.)</p>

<p>Head Start will be especially affected in the wake of Kennedy’s mass firings of Office of Head Start regional staff and news that the president’s draft budget proposes <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2025/04/11/trump-proposal-eliminating-head-start/83045346007/">eliminating funding for the program altogether</a>. That would leave one million working-class parents who rely on Head Start not only for pre-K education but also for child care, particularly in rural areas, with nowhere to send their kids during the day. </p>

<p>Some local Head Start programs <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/education-lab/central-wa-head-start-programs-shut-down-without-federal-funding/">are already having to close their doors</a>, and many program directors are encountering impediments to spending their current budgets. When they seek reimbursement after paying their teachers or purchasing school supplies, they’re being directed to a new “Defend the Spend” DOGE website asking them to “justify” each item, even though the spending has already been appropriated by Congress and audited by nonpartisan civil servants.</p>

<p>Next <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/republicans-in-congress-considering-harsh-medicaid-cuts-that-would-shift-costs-to">on the chopping block</a>, it appears, is Medicaid, which serves children in greater numbers <a href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/state-indicator/medicaid-enrollees-by-age/?currentTimeframe=0&amp;sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D">than any other age group</a>. If Republicans in Congress go through with the cuts they’ve been discussing, and Trump signs those cuts into law, kids from lower- and middle-class families across the U.S. will lose access to health care at their schools, in foster care, for their disabilities or for cancer treatment.</p>

<p>The Trump administration has touted the president’s record of “protecting America’s children,” asserting in a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/03/president-trump-is-protecting-americas-children/">recent post</a> that Trump will “never stop fighting for their right to a healthy, productive upbringing.” The statement listed five examples of that commitment. Four were related to transgender issues (including making it U.S. government policy that there are only two sexes and keeping trans athletes out of women’s sports); the other was a ban on COVID-19 vaccine mandates at schools that receive federal funding.</p>

<p>The White House, and multiple agencies, declined to respond to most of ProPublica’s questions. Madi Biedermann, a Department of Education spokesperson, addressed the elimination of pandemic recovery funding, saying that “COVID is over”; that the Biden administration established an “irresponsible precedent” by extending the deadline to spend these funds (and exceeding their original purpose); and that the department will consider extensions if individual projects show a clear connection between COVID and student learning. </p>

<p>An HHS spokesperson, in response to ProPublica’s questions about cuts to children’s programs across that agency, sent a short statement saying that the department, guided by Trump, is restructuring with a focus on cutting wasteful bureaucracy. The offices serving children, the statement said, will be merged into a newly established “Administration for Healthy America.” </p>


<p>Programs that serve kids <a href="https://advisory.avalerehealth.com/press-releases/graham-cassidy-heller-johnson-bill-would-reduce-federal-funding-to-states-by-215-billion">have</a> <a href="https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1995-08-11/pdf/CREC-1995-08-11-pt1-PgS12339.pdf">historically</a> fared the worst when those in power are looking for ways to cut the budget. That’s in part because kids can’t vote, and they typically don’t belong to political organizations. International aid groups, another constituency <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-doge-rubio-usaid-musk-death-toll-malaria-polio-tuberculosis">devastated by</a> Trump’s policy agenda, also can’t say that they represent many U.S. voters.</p>

<p>This dynamic may be part of why cuts on the health side of the Department of Health and Human Services — layoffs of doctors, medical researchers and the like — <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/27/health/hhs-rfk-job-cuts/index.html">have received more political and press attention</a> than those on the human services side, where the Administration for Children and Families is located. That’s where you can find the Office of Child Support Services, the Office of Head Start, the Office of Child Care (which promotes minimum health and safety standards for child care programs nationally and helps states reduce the cost of child care for families), the Office of Family Assistance (which helps states administer direct aid to lower-income parents and kids), the Children’s Bureau (which oversees child protective services, foster care and adoption) and the Family and Youth Services Bureau (which aids runaway and homeless teens, among others).</p>

<p>All told, these programs have seen their staffs cut from roughly 2,400 employees as of January to 1,500 now, according to a shared Google document that is being regularly updated by former HHS officials. (Neither the White House nor agency leadership have released the exact numbers of cuts.)</p>

<p>Those losses have been most acutely felt in the agency’s regional offices, five out of 10 of which — covering over 20 states — have been closed by the Trump administration. They were dissolved this month without notice to their own employees or to the local providers they worked with. It was these outposts that had monitored Head Start programs to make sure that they had fences around their playgrounds, gates at the top of their stairs and enough staffing to keep an eye on even the most energetic little ones. It was also the regional staff who had helped state child support programs modernize their computer systems and navigate federal law. That allowed them, among other things, to be able to “<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/more-states-allow-child-support-to-reach-children">pass through</a>” more money to families instead of <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/to-get-public-assistance-these-single-mothers-are-forced-to-share-intimate-details-about-their-families">depositing it in state coffers</a> to reimburse themselves for costs.</p>

<p>And it was the regional staff who’d had the relationships with tribal officials that allowed them to routinely work together to address child support, child care and child welfare challenges faced by Native families. Together, they had worked to overcome sometimes deep distrust of the federal government among tribal leaders, who may now have no one to ask for help with their children’s programs other than political appointees in D.C.</p>

<p>In the wake of the regional office cuts, local child services program directors have no idea who in the federal government to call when they have urgent concerns, many told ProPublica. “No one knows anything,” said one state child support director, asking not to be named in order to speak candidly about the administration’s actions. “We have no idea who will be auditing us.”</p>

<p>“We’re trying to be reassuring to our families,” the official said, “but if the national system goes down, so does ours.”</p>

<p>That national system includes the complex web of databases and technical support maintained and provided by the Office of Child Support Services at HHS, which helps states locate parents who owe child support in order to withhold part of their paychecks or otherwise obtain the money they owe, which is then sent to the parent who has custody of the child. Without this federal data and assistance, child support orders would have little way of being enforced across state lines.</p>

<p>For that reason, the Trump administration is making a risky gamble by slashing staffing at the federal child support office, said Vicki Turetsky, who headed that office under the Obama administration. She worries that the layoffs create a danger of system outages that would cause child support payments to be missed or delayed. (“That’s a family’s rent,” she said.) The instability is compounded, she said, by DOGE’s recent unexplained <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/03/08/hhs-doge-child-support/">move to access</a> a highly confidential national child support database.</p>

<p>But even if the worst doesn’t come to pass, there will still be concrete consequences for the delivery of child support to families, Turetsky said. The staff members who’ve been pushed out include those who’d helped manage complicated, outdated IT systems; without updates, these programs might over- or undershoot the amount of child support that a parent owes, misdirect the money or fail to give notice to the dad or mom about a change in the case. </p>


<p>When Liz Ryan departed as administrator of <a href="https://ojjdp.ojp.gov/">the Department of Justice’s juvenile division</a> in January, its website was flush with opportunities for state and local law enforcement as well as nonprofits to apply for federal funding for a myriad of initiatives that help children. There were funds for local police task forces that investigate child exploitation on the internet; for programs where abused children are interviewed by police and mental health professionals; and for court-appointed advocates for victimized kids. Grants were also available for mentoring programs like Big Brothers Big Sisters and the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America. </p>

<p>But the Trump administration removed those grant applications, which total over $400 million in a typical year. And Ryan said there still hasn’t been any communication, including in what used to be regular emails with grant recipients, many of whom she remains in touch with, about whether this congressionally approved money even still exists or whether some of it might eventually be made available again.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the Office of Justice Programs within the DOJ said the agency is reviewing programs, policies and materials and “taking action as appropriate” in accordance with Trump’s executive orders and guidance. When that review has been completed, local agencies and programs seeking grants will be notified.</p>

<p>Multiple nonprofits serving exploited children declined to speak on the record to ProPublica, fearing that doing so might undermine what chance they still had of getting potential grants.</p>

<p>“Look at what happened to the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/09/us/politics/trump-law-firms-orders.html">law firms</a>,” one official said, adding that time is running out to fund his program’s services for victims of child abuse for the upcoming fiscal year.</p>

<p>“I never anticipated that programs and services and opportunities for young people wouldn’t be funded at all by the federal government,” Ryan said, adding that local children’s organizations likely can’t go to states, whose budgets <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/politics/medicaid-cuts-republican-budget.html">are already underwater</a>, to make up the funding gap. “When you look at this alongside what they’re doing at HHS and the Department of Education and to Medicaid, it’s undercutting every single effort that we have to serve kids.”</p>

<p>Environmentalists have long faced <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/dec/20/threats-intimidation-creating-climate-of-fear-un-cop-events">harassment</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/28/world/asia/vietnam-cop28-environment.html">imprisonment</a> and <a href="https://globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/land-and-environmental-defenders/missing-voices/">other forms of retribution</a> in some parts of the world. The U.S. has largely been an exception, a place where people and organizations can freely and safely pursue efforts to protect human health and nature — sometimes working hand in hand with the government. </p>

<p>But the treatment of people who fight pollution has palpably changed in recent months. </p>

<p>Nonprofit environmental groups are facing attacks from the Trump administration, subpoenas from criminal investigations, online harassment and industry lawsuits they say are designed to intimidate them into silence. In recent weeks, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/17/us/politics/harvard-trump-irs-liberals.html">fears have grown</a> that the administration will seek to revoke the nonprofit status of at least some groups. </p>

<p>Today, on Earth Day, ProPublica is publishing an interview with Abigail Dillen, president of Earthjustice, the country’s biggest public interest environmental firm, about the escalating hostility environmentalists face. Over the past five decades, Earthjustice’s lawyers have helped to establish the first federal limits on mercury and other chemicals emitted by power plants, successfully pushed for bans on toxic pesticides and fought to protect hundreds of <a href="https://earthjustice.org/brief/2025/lets-not-sign-up-for-70-more-years-of-offshore-oil-drilling">endangered species</a>.  </p>

<p>But the future of the environmental movement is in peril. The shift has been led in no small part by the Environmental Protection Agency, which is tasked with protecting the public’s air and water. President Donald Trump’s head of the EPA, Lee Zeldin, has defunded and sharply criticized some environmental organizations. For eight nonprofit groups that received $20 billion in federal money aimed at promoting clean energy, Zeldin has gone further, working with the FBI on a criminal investigation into the <a href="https://www.epa.gov/greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund">Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund</a>, the grant program that funds them. </p>

<p>The EPA moved to cancel the funding in February after Zeldin likened the congressionally authorized grant program to throwing <a href="https://x.com/epaleezeldin/status/1889840040622321778">gold bars off the Titanic</a>. Zeldin told Fox News that “the entire scheme, in my opinion, is criminal,” suggesting there was self-dealing and conflicts of interest. A grand jury was launched to investigate his claims. Although a judge has found that the EPA has yet to produce <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/16/climate/epa-clean-energy-ruling/index.html">any evidence of wrongdoing</a>, the agency froze the funds and federal authorities sent subpoenas to the organizations that received the money.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>Zeldin and Trump have publicly called out environmental activists by name. After Fox News showed a picture of Beth Bafford, the executive director of one group, during an interview with Zeldin, she said she received dozens of messages and threats on her voicemail. On social media, people have responded to Zeldin’s online allegations with calls to imprison the people he is targeting, charge them with treason and even execute them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, green groups are facing threats from lawsuits they say are designed to intimidate and wear down advocacy organizations. Dozens of states have adopted laws to discourage so-called strategic lawsuits against public participation, or SLAPP suits. In March, a jury in North Dakota, which does not have an anti-SLAPP law, found the environmental organization Greenpeace <a href="https://apnews.com/article/greenpeace-dakota-access-pipeline-lawsuit-verdict-5036944c1d2e7d3d7b704437e8110fbb">liable for more than $660 million</a> for its role in protests over the Dakota Access Pipeline. The pipeline company, Energy Transfer, argued in court that Greenpeace defamed the company and orchestrated criminal behavior by protestors. Greenpeace has vowed to appeal the verdict.</p>

<p>These events have taken place as the new administration makes energy production a main focus, shifting the EPA’s priorities to include deregulation and “restoring energy dominance,” making the U.S. the artificial intelligence capital of the world and bringing back jobs in the auto industry. The agency claims that, contrary to what a lot of its critics have said, these changes won’t affect its commitment to protecting clean air and clean water. </p>

<p>Dillen sees the Greenpeace case and the <a href="https://www.barrons.com/news/process-is-the-punishment-the-rise-of-slapp-suits-in-the-us-e720c992">increase of lawsuits targeting free speech</a> more broadly, as just one of the growing threats to organizations that work to preserve the environment — and the people who staff them. She spoke to ProPublica about the targeting of nonprofit groups, how the second Trump administration is different from the first and what keeps her up at night. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. ProPublica reached out to the EPA and the White House for comment but did not receive a response.</p>
        
    
                        
    
        Nonprofit executives have recently told me about having their lives transformed. One day they’re working on fulfilling grant requirements, the next they’re being accused of participating in a criminal “scheme.” Do you know of others in this situation?
    
        
    
                    
<p>Yes. I have heard of people being harassed at their homes. This is what happens when the federal government sends a signal that people who have lawfully been granted money by the government are actually scammers and fraudsters. This effort to criminalize people who have properly received government grants has outsized impacts online and in real life.</p>
        
    
                        
    
        Is this new?
    
        
    
                    
<p>I can’t remember any instance of the kind that we’re seeing now. It’s not the first time that clients of ours have received threats. Earthjustice has received threats over the years. But it’s a very different thing when the federal government — the EPA administrator, the president himself — are personally targeting people online. That is fundamentally different and it’s having a fundamentally different impact.</p>
        
    
                        
    
        Earthjustice recently hired an outside law firm to help the organization’s clients with SLAPP suits. Why did you feel the need to do that now?
    
        
    
                    
<p>SLAPP suits are not new. And in part that’s why we have <a href="https://www.rcfp.org/resources/anti-slapp-laws/">anti-SLAPP legislation</a> in many states. What’s happened now is the tone that the president is setting from the top, popularizing the idea that people trying to work in the public interest are actually hurting the country. That gives license to big corporations to be deploying highly disfavored tactics like SLAPP suits. I’m concerned that the attitude this administration is projecting about civil society is so negative that it will encourage more hostile activity by the private sector. I also fear that the very notable ruling in the SLAPP suit against Greenpeace will embolden other companies and other big law firms.</p>
        
    
                        
    
        We’ve seen the administration make plans to rescind Harvard University’s nonprofit status. Do you worry about the same thing happening to environmental groups?
    
        
    
                    
<p>I worry about this administration in all ways. But of course, any action of that kind would be illegal. The president cannot weaponize the IRS by directing audits or stripping away tax-exempt status without due process and legitimate reasons. This kind of attack would strike at the core of our democracy and set a precedent that threatens not only environmental groups but all kinds of charitable organizations, from neighborhood churches to disaster relief and medical research institutions.</p>

<p>(Editor’s note: While <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/harvard-tax-exempt-status-irs-trump-what-to-know/">many experts</a> agree it <a href="https://apnews.com/article/harvard-nonprofit-tax-exempt-status-how-can-it-be-revoked-096614ea5ec65ec7a6ac08efd0f1e94f">would be illegal</a> for Trump to instruct the IRS to remove Harvard’s nonprofit status, the president has argued that being tax exempt is “a privilege” that can be revoked. On Monday, <a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2025/04/21/zeldin-a-no-on-targeting-climate-groups-tax-exempt-status-00301053">Politico reported</a> that Zeldin told reporters he did not think the government should broadly reconsider the nonprofit status of environmental groups.)</p>
        
    
                        
    
        I’ve noticed that environmental leaders are more hesitant to talk publicly. What do you think they stand to lose by speaking out?
    
        
    
                    
<p>Across the board, this administration is deploying federal power and the power of the Justice Department, even the FBI, in ways that make it increasingly frightening for anyone to speak out. Now there is clearly a risk that by doing your ordinary job, you may become a target of the administration. For the recipients of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, that targeting has taken the form of a grand jury inquiry.</p>
        
    
                        
    
        How is the new administration’s approach to environmental issues different from that of the first Trump administration?
    
        
    
                    
<p>In the first Trump administration, you had a very aggressive agenda to roll back environmental protections, but the method was not so different from what past administrations had done. It was largely hewing to the legally mandated process of proposing new rules, finalizing replacement policies and putting in place weaker policies. In retrospect, it looks quite conventional because there was at least an optical compliance with the normal process.</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p>Now you have the administration pushing an even more radical agenda to deregulate and so far they’re dispensing with the usual process. So you have the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/declaring-a-national-energy-emergency/">declaration of the energy emergency</a>, and that is becoming the pretext for making decisions without complying with the usual permitting process. You have this new announcement that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/trump-epa-invites-companies-seek-exemptions-air-rules-by-email-2025-03-27/">regulated industries can apply for presidential exemptions</a> that would relieve them of compliance obligations. Now note that that would apply to even Biden administration regulations that the Supreme Court has declined to stay. This is an end run around regulations that are on the books today.</p>
        
    
                        
    
        So has Earthjustice’s strategy changed, too?
    
        
    
                    
<p>It has. When I imagined what our first cases would be, I imagined we would be fighting efforts to stay life-saving regulations, that we would be fighting over efforts to pause compliance obligations in federal court. And that certainly has been happening. But I would not have imagined that we would be working around the clock to <a href="https://earthjustice.org/press/2025/farmers-nonprofits-sue-trump-administration-for-freezing-ira-grant-funds">challenge paused funding for farmers</a> or that we would be fending off immediate <a href="https://earthjustice.org/press/2025/new-challenge-to-trump-administration-attempt-to-terminate-new-yorks-congestion-pricing-program">efforts by the Trump administration to block congestion pricing in NYC</a>. </p>

<p>I do believe there are remedies in the court for what is happening.</p>
        
    
                        
    
        What if the courts find in your favor, but the administration doesn’t abide by their decision? Is that something that keeps you up at night?
    
        
    
                    
<p>I worry very much about losing the rule of law in this country.</p>
        
    
                        
    
        Are you sleeping well?
    
        
    
                    
<p>No.</p>
        
    
                        
    
        What do you think the targeting of environmentalists achieves or aims to achieve?
    
        
    
                    
<p>The Trump administration is very significantly bankrolled by the fossil fuels industry. It has been widely reported that the president <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/09/trump-oil-industry-campaign-money/">promised to give many favors to the industry while asking for their financial support</a>. And the president is delivering on those promises by taking aim at climate policies and the groups that have successfully advocated for them. There is, I think, something larger in play, which is that climate solutions are going to drive significant changes in our economy and the president is choosing to throw in with powerful incumbent industries rather than allowing for fair competition in the country. And one part of justifying this approach publicly is to silence groups who are effectively lifting up the reality of climate change and the urgent need to address it.</p>
        
    
                        
    
        Do you fear that this country is becoming a dangerous place for people who do environmental work?
    
        
    
                    
<p>I hope with every fiber of my being that we are not becoming one of those countries. But do I see it as possible? Absolutely.</p>

Title    : New Law Increases Oversight of Arizona Sober Living Homes

<p>Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs has signed legislation increasing oversight of sober living homes, two years after state officials announced that a Medicaid fraud scheme had targeted Native Americans seeking drug and alcohol treatment. </p>

<p><a href="https://apps.azleg.gov/BillStatus/BillOverview/82688">The bill, sponsored by three Republicans</a>, amends state law for the regulation and licensing of sober living homes. It places new demands on the Arizona Department of Health Services, though a lawmaker from the Navajo Nation expressed concern that the bill does not go far enough in addressing root causes of the fraud.</p>

<p>Hobbs’ office announced late Friday that the bill, expected to take effect in the fall, was among dozens she had signed into law. The governor did not explain her decision to sign the legislation but she has been vocal in her support of reforms over the past two years <a href="https://azmirror.com/briefs/hobbs-arizonans-should-be-outraged-at-the-sober-living-home-scandal/">to help authorities “go after bad actors.”</a></p>

<p>The legislation’s passage comes after ProPublica and the Arizona Center for Investigative Reporting reported in January that former state Medicaid officials had failed for years to stem the $2 billion fraud scheme, despite repeated warnings. Starting around 2019, people were lured into substance abuse treatment programs and housed in sober living homes where operators often allowed patients to continue using drugs and alcohol, according to officials. Meanwhile, many providers excessively billed the state’s American Indian Health Program, Medicaid insurance available to tribal citizens, for treatment they did not deliver. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/arizona-sober-homes-deaths-medicaid-fraud">At least 40 people died in sober living homes</a> from the spring of 2022 to the summer of 2024 as the crisis escalated, Maricopa County Medical Examiner records reviewed by the news organizations showed. Victims’ advocates say they are certain the scheme’s toll is far higher. In interviews, victims’ relatives told ProPublica and AZCIR that they had been left in the dark about the circumstances of their loved ones’ deaths, including not knowing the names or addresses of the facilities where their family members had been staying because no one had informed them.</p>

<p>“I believe that this bill will set standards,” Rep. Cesar Aguilar, a Democrat from Phoenix, said before voting for the measure. “It will force businesses to actually help the most vulnerable.”</p>

<p>The League of Arizona Cities and Towns, a nonprofit that lobbies on behalf of municipalities and that supported the measure, said in a news release that a noteworthy component of the bill includes “mandating timely reporting” to the Arizona Department of Health Services — in addition to family members and emergency contacts — when a resident dies, overdoses or suffers severe harm in a facility. The health department will also be required to notify local governments when new licenses are issued to operators of sober living homes, which the league said will “improve transparency and community awareness.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p>Under the bill, the health department’s director will set standards and requirements for sober living homes to maintain a drug- and alcohol-free environment and promote health and addiction recovery. Health officials could revoke or suspend licenses depending on the severity of a violation or issue fines of up to $1,000 for each day that a violation goes unaddressed. </p>

<p>At a minimum, the health department will conduct annual inspections of facilities and report to lawmakers on the number of complaints received regarding licensed or unlicensed facilities and how many resulted in investigations or other enforcement actions.  </p>

<p>The bill received bipartisan support. However, critics said it did not address additional factors that contributed to the fraud scheme: Many victims stayed in unlicensed facilities and, despite warnings, the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System, the state’s Medicaid agency, was slow to grasp the scope of the fraud and stop it. </p>

<p>It wasn’t until May 2023 that AHCCCS and the governor, who took office that year, announced a sweeping investigation of hundreds of facilities and launched a hotline to help victims who were recruited into fraudulent programs or displaced after AHCCCS suspended payments to the businesses. The agency has since enacted a series of reforms in response to the fraud. In an interview last year, a deputy director for AHCCCS also acknowledged that the agency’s American Indian Health Program lacked safeguards for fraud. </p>

<p>Supporters of this year’s bill have touted support from tribes. </p>

<p>Reva Stewart, who is Diné and an advocate for victims of the scheme and their families, opposed the bill. She anticipates the measure will make it more burdensome for licensed facilities to help people seeking treatment, while failing to stop the unlicensed homes, where most of the harm was done. ProPublica and AZCIR found that officials’ botched response to the crisis resulted in <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/arizona-medicaid-fraud-crackdown-native-american-patients">Native Americans losing access to behavioral health services</a> that were being provided to them.</p>

<p>Sen. Theresa Hatathlie, a Democrat from Coalmine Mesa on the Navajo Nation, was also critical of the legislation. She voted against it, noting that a bill she sponsored last session would have required more accountability not only from the health department related to its oversight of the homes but also from the Arizona Corporation Commission, where the businesses must be registered.  </p>

<p>Hatathlie, whose niece died in one of the homes, said this year’s Republican sponsors of sober home legislation did not include her in their discussions. </p>

<p>“We’re actually not solving the problem,” she said during a Senate floor vote last month. “So to say it’s good enough now, when we still have people dying and getting lost in the system, is a disservice to human lives. These are my relatives. These are my family members.”</p>

<p>Sen. Frank Carroll, the bill’s lead sponsor, didn’t immediately respond to an email and phone calls requesting comment.</p>
        
             

                                    
        
                        <p>Maria Polletta, a senior reporter and associate editor at AZCIR, contributed reporting.</p>

Title    : Politically Connected Firms Benefit From Trump Tariff Exemptions Amid Secrecy, Confusion

<p>After President Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs earlier this month, the White House released a list of more than a thousand products that would be exempted. </p>

<p>One item that made <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Annex-II.pdf">the list</a> is polyethylene terephthalate, more commonly known as PET resin, the thermoplastic used to make plastic bottles. </p>

<p>Why it was spared is unclear, and even people in the industry are confused about the reason for the reprieve. </p>

<p>But its inclusion is a win for Reyes Holdings, a Coca-Cola bottler that ranks among the largest privately held companies in the U.S. and is owned by a pair of brothers who have donated millions of dollars to Republican causes. Records show the company recently hired a lobbying firm with close ties to the Trump White House to make its case on tariffs.</p>

<p>Whether the company’s lobbying played any role in the exemption is unclear. Reyes Holdings and its lobbyists did not respond to questions from ProPublica. The White House also did not comment, but some industry advocates say the administration has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/19/trump-is-signaling-hes-open-to-tariff-exemptions-securing-one-is-a-different-question-00298558">rebuffed requests for exemptions</a>.</p>

<p>The resin’s unexplained inclusion on the list exemplifies how opaque the administration’s process for crafting its tariff policy has been. Major stakeholders are in the dark about why certain products face levies and others don’t. <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/trumps-tariff-on-india-26-then-27-now-26/articleshow/119995329.cms">Tariff rates</a> have been altered without any clear explanation for the changes. Administration officials have given <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/06/trump-tariffs-administration-reacts">conflicting messages</a> about the tariffs or declined to answer questions at all. </p>

<p>The lack of transparency about the process has created concerns among trade experts that politically connected firms might be winning carve-outs behind closed doors.</p>

<p>“It could be corruption, but it could just as easily be incompetence,” a lobbyist who works on tariff policy said of PET resin’s inclusion. “To be honest, this was such a hurried mess, I am not sure who got into the White House to talk to folks about the list.”</p>
        
    
                    
<p>During the first Trump administration, there was a formal process for seeking an exemption from tariffs. Companies submitted hundreds of thousands of applications making the case for why their products should be spared. The applications were public, so the machinery of the tariff crafting process could be more closely examined. Such transparency allowed academics to subsequently analyze thousands of the applications and determine that political donors to Republicans <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-financial-and-quantitative-analysis/article/political-economy-of-tariff-exemption-grants/6777AC0EB32328B3E45A617F9B3E07E5">were more likely to be granted exemptions</a>. </p>

<p>In Trump’s second term, at least thus far, there has not been a formal application process for tariff carve-outs. Industry <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-always-up-good-negotiation-white-house-says-april-2-liberation-day-tariffs-loom">executives and lobbyists</a> are making their case <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/trump-tariffs-automaker-prices-warning-928bc7a9">behind closed doors</a>. The Wall Street Journal’s editorial board last week called “the opacity of the process” for getting an exemption “the Beltway Swamp’s dream.” </p>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/regulating-imports-with-a-reciprocal-tariff-to-rectify-trade-practices-that-contribute-to-large-and-persistent-annual-united-states-goods-trade-deficits/">executive order formalizing Trump’s new tariffs</a>, including baseline 10% tariffs for almost all countries, exemptions were broadly defined as products in the pharmaceutical, semiconductor, lumber, copper, critical minerals and energy sectors. An accompanying list detailed the specific products that would be spared. </p>

<p>But a ProPublica review of that list found many items that don’t fit neatly, or at all, in those broad categories, and some items that fall squarely within the categories were not spared.</p>

<p>The White House exclusions list, for example, included most types of asbestos, which is not generally considered a critical mineral and doesn’t seem to fit in any of the exempted categories. The cancer-causing mineral, which is not generally considered critical to national security or the U.S. economy, is still used to make chlorine, but the Biden administration’s Environmental Protection Agency banned imports of the material last year. The Trump administration has signaled it may roll back some of those Biden-era restrictions.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the American Chemistry Council, which had pushed back on the ban because it could hurt the chlorine industry, said the trade group played no role in lobbying for asbestos to get a tariff exemption and didn’t know why it was included. (Two major chlorine companies also showed no indication of lobbying on the tariffs in their disclosure forms.) </p>

<p>Other items that landed on the list, despite not falling into exempted categories, are far more innocuous. Among them: coral, shells and cuttlebone, a part of the cuttlefish that is used as a dietary supplement for pets. </p>

<p>PET resin also doesn’t fit neatly in any of the exempted categories. It’s possible the administration counted it as an energy product, experts said, because its ingredients are derived from petroleum. But other products that would have met that same low bar were not included. </p>

<p>“We are as surprised as anybody,” said Ralph Vasami, executive director of the PET Resin Association, a trade group for the industry. The resin, he said, has no application for the exempted categories, unless you count the packaging those products come in.</p>

<p>During the fourth quarter of last year, the same period when Trump won the election, records show Reyes Holdings, the Coca-Cola bottler, enlisted Ballard Partners to lobby on tariffs. During the first quarter of this year, when Trump was inaugurated, <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/e8c52cd4-c02e-4529-b1a3-8c8b5e07c830/print/">records show</a> that Ballard began lobbying the Commerce Department, which shapes trade policy, on tariffs.</p>

<p>The firm has become a destination for companies looking for an in with the Trump administration. It once lobbied for Trump’s own company, the Trump Organization, and its staff has included top officials in the administration, such as Attorney General Pam Bondi and the president’s chief of staff, Susie Wiles. Brian Ballard, its founder and a prolific fundraiser for Trump, was named by Politico “the most powerful lobbyist in Trump’s Washington.” He was one of two lobbyists from the firm who lobbied on tariffs for Reyes Holdings, federal disclosure records show.</p>

<p>The billionaire brothers behind Reyes Holdings, Chris and Jude Reyes, also have their own political ties. While they have given to some Democratic candidates, the bulk of their political donations have gone to Republican causes, campaign finance disclosures show. And after Trump’s first election win, Chris Reyes was invited to Mar-a-Lago to meet privately with Trump. </p>

<p>The PET resin carve-out isn’t just a break for Reyes Holdings. It’s a boon to other firms that buy the resin to manufacture bottles and the beverage companies that use them. Earlier this year, the CEO of Coca-Cola said the company would transition to using more plastic bottles in the face of new tariffs on aluminum, a plan that might have been dashed if the thermoplastics were also hit with new tariffs. <a href="https://lda.senate.gov/filings/public/filing/7b10eb35-6296-479a-901c-7d42a1b9ceda/print/">Disclosure records</a> show the company also lobbied this year about tariffs on the Hill, but the documents don’t provide detail about which policies in particular, and the company did not respond to questions from ProPublica. (Coca-Cola has looked to make inroads with Trump, donating about $250,000 for his inauguration, and the CEO presented Trump with a personalized bottle of his favorite soda, Diet Coke.) </p>

<p>Another industry that appears to have done relatively well lobbying for carve-outs from the recent tariffs is agriculture. The exemption list includes various pesticide and fertilizer ingredients.</p>

<p>The American Farm Bureau Federation, an agricultural lobby, <a href="https://www.fb.org/market-intel/understanding-the-new-tariffs">took credit for some of those exemptions</a> in an analysis posted on its website recently, calling exemptions for peat and potash “hard fought for by agricultural organizations such as the American Farm Bureau Federation” and “a testament to the effectiveness of farmers’ and ranchers raising their collective voice.”</p>

<p>There are a number of other imports that don’t neatly fall into any of the exempted categories but might if the categories were defined loosely. </p>

<p>One example is sucralose, the artificial sweetener. Its inclusion will largely help companies that use the product in food and beverages. But sucralose is also sometimes used in drugs to make them more palatable. It’s not clear if the White House gave it a pass under the pharmaceutical exemption or for some other reason.</p>

<p>Even for the items that were spared, the reprieve may just be temporary. </p>

<p>The broad categories exempted are largely industries that are being investigated by the administration for potential future tariffs under its authority to administer levies to protect national security.</p>

Title    : Trump Laid Off Nearly All the Federal Workers Who Investigate Firefighter Deaths

<p>When a firefighter dies in the line of duty, a small team of federal health workers is often called on to pinpoint what went wrong and identify how to avoid similar accidents in the future.</p>

<p>That’s what happened after <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/firefighters/programs/pdfs/face202010.pdf">two firefighters died</a> in California in 2020 while searching for an elderly woman in a burning library. It happened in 2023 when <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/firefighters/programs/pdfs/face202309.pdf">a Navy firefighter died</a> in Maryland after a floor collapsed in a burning home. And it happened last year in Georgia when <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/firefighters/programs/pdfs/face202405.pdf">a career battalion chief died</a> after a semitrailer truck exploded.</p>

<p>But President Donald Trump’s administration has taken steps to fire nearly all of the Department of Health and Human Services employees responsible for conducting those reviews.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/06/health/cdc-niosh-cuts-safety/index.html">At least two-thirds of the employees at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health</a>, an agency within HHS, were notified on April 1 that they had been laid off or will be in June. These cuts included seven of the eight members of the Fire Fighter Fatality Investigation and Prevention Program, the team that studies firefighter line-of-duty deaths, one of the laid-off investigators told ProPublica.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>Most nonunionized NIOSH workers were given until the end of the day to clear out their desks. The layoffs were so abrupt, staff said, that lab animals were left without staff to care for them and <a href="https://westvirginiawatch.com/2025/04/01/more-than-200-jobs-eliminated-during-doge-cuts-at-morgantowns-niosh-facility/">had to be euthanized</a>, and <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/divisions-offices/pittsburgh-mining.html">an experimental mine used to test protective gear</a> beneath the agency’s Pittsburgh campus was <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/career-workplace/2025/04/01/niosh-trump-doge-musk-mine-pittsburgh/stories/202504010086">at risk of flooding and polluting the surrounding environment</a>.</p>

<p>“It was pure chaos,” another NIOSH employee said.</p>

<p>The fatality investigation team was examining deaths at 20 fire departments when the layoff notices arrived. Those probes are now unlikely to be completed, the investigator said.</p>

<p>“The whole intent of this program was that people would learn through tragedy — what happened to one person — so we can prevent it from happening to others,” the investigator said.</p>

<p>The administration’s moves will also halt a first-of-its-kind study of the causes of thousands of firefighters’ cancer cases and disrupt a program that provides health care <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/13/trump-health-cuts-world-trade-center-program-911">to emergency personnel who responded to the World Trade Center terrorist attacks</a>.</p>

<p>ProPublica spoke with five NIOSH employees who either led or contributed to firefighter health initiatives and received layoff notices. Most requested anonymity for fear of retribution from the administration.</p>

<p>“The existence of NIOSH is a hard-earned right by the people of America to have a healthy and safe working environment,” said Micah Niemeier-Walsh, vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 3840, which represents agency employees. “This is an attack on NIOSH employees and federal employees, but it is also an attack on American workers generally.”</p>

<p>Neither the White House nor Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, which has called the shots on many of the administration’s cuts, responded to a request for comment. A NIOSH spokesperson referred questions to HHS.</p>

<p>HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/03/health/kennedy-hhs-cuts-lead">has made some public indications</a> that aspects of the World Trade Center program could be spared, but details remain sparse. The department’s spokesperson said in a statement that programs required by law — such as some of those focused on firefighter health — will continue to operate.</p>

<p>They did not respond to a follow-up question about how those programs will continue after their staffs were terminated.</p>

“It Breaks My Heart”
<p>The investigations performed by the Fire Fighter Fatality Investigation and Prevention Program are initiated at the request of the fire department that suffered the casualty. The findings are shared with the firefighter’s family in hopes of providing some closure. And <a href="https://wwwn.cdc.gov/NIOSH-fire-fighter-face/">the reports are then published</a>, so the broader firefighting community can strengthen its procedures to avoid similar losses.</p>

<p>The Trump administration had already hamstrung the program shortly after the inauguration, initially barring the investigative team from traveling to conduct research, communicating with other agencies and publishing reports, according to the investigator. While the department eventually allowed several of the casualty reports to be published, the rest remain unfinished.</p>

<p>“It breaks my heart that we’re going to just destroy these programs that have made so much progress in protecting the health and safety of our firefighting community,” the investigator said.</p>

<p>The layoff notice the investigator received from HHS said that termination of much of the agency’s staff was “because your duties have been identified as either unnecessary or virtually identical to duties being performed elsewhere in the agency.”</p>

<p>“Leadership at HHS are appreciative of your service,” the notice stated.</p>

<p>The federal firefighting force faces a daunting year, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-funding-freeze-wildfire-season">with spending cuts canceling prescribed burns</a> to reduce flammable vegetation and <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-doge-cuts-forest-service-firefighting">the termination of hundreds of firefighting support staff</a>, even in the face of climate-change-lengthened wildfire seasons.</p>

<p>“At a time when we need to be bolstering these efforts and personnel, it’s pretty damn appalling that we’d be trying to diminish the health benefits for our firefighters and first responders,” a Forest Service firefighter said.</p>

Dismantling the World’s Largest Firefighter Cancer Study
<p>On April 1, the Trump administration also began laying off much of the staff working on the National Firefighter Registry for Cancer.</p>

<p>Its creation in 2018 was a landmark win in a yearslong fight to study why firefighters suffer from certain types of cancer at <a href="https://magazine.uc.edu/issues/0408/firefighters.html">vastly higher rates than the general population</a>. Both chambers of Congress <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/931/all-actions">unanimously passed the bill</a> to create the registry. Trump signed it into law during his first term.</p>

<p>While HHS said in a statement that programs required by law would remain intact, it did not answer a question about whether it would bring back staff to keep the registry running.</p>

<p>Wildland firefighters don’t typically wear respirators while they’re exposed to high levels of smoke. And the protective clothing firefighters wear while battling active blazes <a href="https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2024/12/pfas-found-firefighter-gloves-hoods-and-wildland-gear">contains high levels of PFAS</a>, or “forever chemicals,” that have been linked to various types of cancer. But the exact causes of some cancers that occur at high rates among firefighters are not well understood. Female-specific cancers such as ovarian and cervical, for example, <a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/01/women-firefighters-reproductive-cancers-federal-help/">have only recently been linked to firefighting</a>.</p>

<p>More than 23,000 firefighters have signed <a href="https://app.powerbigov.us/view?r=eyJrIjoiZWZlNzI3Y2YtY2U4NC00MzY5LTgyNmQtZmIyYTFiMmFkOWJhIiwidCI6IjljZTcwODY5LTYwZGItNDRmZC1hYmU4LWQyNzY3MDc3ZmM4ZiJ9">up to participate since the registry launched in April 2023</a>, and the research team recently began an outreach campaign to get to 200,000 participants. With this trove of data, NIOSH researchers planned to dig into numerous under-studied questions, such as what workplace exposures led to cancers that specifically harmed female firefighters, a NIOSH scientist who worked on the program told ProPublica.</p>

<p>Among the thousands who signed up was a federal wildland firefighter who was concerned about spending a career breathing wildfire smoke without a respirator. The decision to throw away such research is disturbing, the firefighter told ProPublica. “I was hoping that something would happen with all that research, that they would protect wildland firefighters.”</p>

<p>With a hollowed-out IT department, the registry’s portal to enroll firefighters quickly went offline.</p>

<p>“It’s devastating,” said Judith Graber, an associate professor at the Rutgers School of Public Health and co-chair of the board that advises the registry research team. She said the study is “the largest effort ever taken anywhere to understand cancer in firefighters,” but it’s an effort that can’t simply be restarted after the researchers running it are laid off.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2023/04/18/firefighters-pfas-forever-chemicals-massachusetts">Diane Cotter became an activist</a> when her husband, a career firefighter, developed prostate cancer, and she fought for funding of research such as the registry. While she’s a Kennedy supporter, Cotter said the administration went too far in cutting the program and other first responder health initiatives such as the World Trade Center program, which she called “sacred.”</p>

<p>“It’s very important we hold the line on these studies,” she said.</p>

Title    : Trump’s War on Measurement Means Losing Data on Drug Use, Maternal Mortality, Climate Change and More

<p>More children ages 1 to 4 die of drowning than any other cause of death. Nearly a quarter of adults received mental health treatment in 2023, an increase of 3.4 million from the prior year. The number of migrants from Mexico and northern Central American countries stopped by the U.S. Border Patrol was surpassed in 2022 by the number of migrants from other nations.</p>

<p>We know these things because the federal government collects, organizes and shares the data behind them. Every year, year after year, workers in agencies that many of us have never heard of have been amassing the statistics that undergird decision-making at all levels of government and inform the judgments of business leaders, school administrators and medical providers nationwide.</p>

<p>The survival of that data is now in doubt, as a result of the Department of Government Efficiency’s comprehensive assault on the federal bureaucracy.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>Reaction to those cuts has focused understandably on the hundreds of thousands of civil servants who have lost their jobs or are on the verge of doing so and the harm that millions of people could suffer as a result of the shuttering of aid programs. Overlooked amid the turmoil is the fact that many of DOGE’s cuts have been targeted at a very specific aspect of the federal government: its collection and sharing of data. In agency after agency, the government is losing its capacity to measure how American society is functioning, making it much harder for elected officials or others to gauge the nature and scale of the problems we are facing and the effectiveness of solutions being deployed against them.</p>

<p>The data collection efforts that have been shut down or are at risk of being curtailed are staggering in their breadth. In some cases, datasets from past years now sit orphaned, their caretakers banished and their future uncertain; in others, past data has vanished for the time being, and it’s unclear if and when it will reappear. Here are just a few examples:</p>

<p>The Department of Health and Human Services, now led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2474698-us-government-fired-researchers-running-a-crucial-drug-use-survey/">laid off the 17-person team</a> in charge of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, which for more than five decades has tracked trends in substance abuse and mental health disorders. The department’s Administration for Children and Families is weeks behind on the annual update of the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System, the nationwide database of child welfare cases, after layoffs effectively wiped out the team that compiles that information. And the department has <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2025/04/01/prams-maternal-mortality-cdc-layoffs/">placed on leave</a> the team that oversees the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, a collection of survey responses from women before and after giving birth that has become a crucial tool in trying to address the country’s disconcertingly high rate of <a href="https://www.propublica.org/series/lost-mothers">maternal mortality</a>.</p>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has eviscerated divisions that oversee the WISQARS database on accidental deaths and injuries — everything from fatal shootings to poisonings to car accidents — and the team that maintains AtlasPlus, an interactive tool for tracking HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.</p>

<p>The Environmental Protection Agency is planning to stop requiring oil refineries, power plants and other industrial facilities to <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-epa-greenhouse-gas-reporting-climate-crisis">measure and report their greenhouse-gas emissions</a>, as they have done since 2010, making it difficult to know whether any of the policies meant to slow climate change and reduce disaster are effective. The EPA has also taken down EJScreen, a mapping tool on its website that allowed people to see how much industrial pollution occurs in their community and how that compares with other places or previous years.</p>

<p>The Office of Homeland Security Statistics has yet to update its <a href="https://ohss.dhs.gov/topics/immigration/immigration-enforcement/monthly-tables">monthly tallies on deportations and other indices of immigration enforcement</a>, making it difficult to judge President Donald Trump’s triumphant claims of a crackdown; the last available numbers are from November 2024, in the final months of President Joe Biden’s tenure. (“While we have submitted reports and data files for clearance, the reporting and data file posting are delayed while they are under the new administration’s review,” Jim Scheye, director of operations and reporting in the statistics unit, told ProPublica.)</p>

<p>And, in a particularly concrete example of ceasing to measure, deep cutbacks at the National Weather Service are forcing it to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2025/04/16/national-weather-service-buyouts-staff-shortages-trump-administration/">reduce weather balloon launches</a>, which gather a vast repository of second-by-second data on everything from temperature to humidity to atmospheric pressure in order to improve forecasting.</p>

<p>Looked at one way, the war on measurement has an obvious potential motivation: making it harder for critics to gauge fallout resulting from Trump administration layoffs, deregulation or other shifts in policy. In some cases, the data now being jettisoned is geared around concepts or presumptions that the administration fundamentally rejects: EJScreen, for instance, stands for “environmental justice” — the effort to ensure that communities don’t suffer disproportionately from pollution and other environmental harms. (An EPA spokesperson said the agency is “working to diligently implement President Trump’s executive orders, including the ‘Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing.’” The spokesperson added: “The EPA will continue to uphold its mission to protect human health and the environment” in Trump’s second term.) The White House press office did not respond to a request for comment.</p>

<p>Laura Lindberg, a Rutgers public health professor, lamented the threatened pregnancy-risk data at the annual conference of the Population Association of America in Washington last week. In an interview, she said the administration’s cancellation of data collection efforts reminded her of recent actions at the state level, such as Florida’s withdrawal in 2022 from the CDC’s Youth Risk Behavior Survey after the state passed its law discouraging classroom discussion of sexual orientation. (The state’s education secretary said the survey was “inflammatory” and “sexualized.”) Discontinuing the survey made it harder to discern whether the law had adverse mental health effects among Florida teens. “States have taken on policies that would harm people and then are saying, ‘We don’t want to collect data about the impact of the policies,’” Lindbergsaid. “Burying your head in the sand is not going to be a way to keep the country healthy.” (HHS did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>

<p>Making the halt on data gathering more confounding, though, is the fact that, in some areas, the information at risk of being lost has been buttressing some of the administration’s own claims. For instance, Trump and Vice President JD Vance have repeatedly cited, as an argument for tougher border enforcement, the past decade’s surge in fentanyl addiction — a trend that has been definitively captured by the national drug use survey that is now imperiled. That survey’s mental health components have also undergirded research on the threat being posed to the nation’s young people by smartphones and social media, which many conservatives have taken up as a cudgel against Big Tech.</p>

<p>Or take education. The administration and its conservative allies have been able to argue that Democratic-led states kept schools closed too long during the pandemic because there was nationwide data — the National Assessment of Educational Progress, aka the Nation’s Report Card — that showed <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/pandemic-covid-education-test-scores-schools-students">greater drops in student achievement in districts that stayed closed longer</a>. But now NAEP is likely to be reduced in scope as part of crippling layoffs at the Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics, which has been slashed from nearly 100 employees to only three, casting into doubt the future not only of NAEP but also of a wide array of long-running longitudinal evaluations and the department’s <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/statprog/handbook/ccd.asp">detailed tallies of nationwide K-12</a> and <a href="https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/InstitutionByName.aspx?goToReportId=1&amp;sid=1310a469-930d-4a9e-b133-c60c11500a41&amp;rtid=1">higher education enrollment</a>. The department did not respond to a request for comment but released a statement on Thursday saying the next round of NAEP assessments would still be held next year.</p>

<p>Dan Goldhaber, an education researcher at the University of Washington, cast the self- defeating nature of the administration’s war on educational assessment in blunt terms: “The irony here is that if you look at some of the statements around the Department of Education, it’s, ‘We’ve invested X billion in the department and yet achievement has fallen off a cliff.’ But the only reason we know that is because of the NAEP data collection effort!”</p>

<p>Shelly Burns, a mathematical statistician who worked at NCES for about 35 years before her entire team was laid off in March, made a similar point about falling student achievement. “How does the country know that? They know it because we collected it. And we didn’t spin it. We didn’t say, ‘Biden is president, so let’s make it look good,’” she said. “Their new idea about how to make education great again — how will you know if it worked if you don’t have independent data collection?”</p>

<p>“Reality has a well-known liberal bias,” Stephen Colbert liked to quip, and there have been plenty of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/08/opinion/facts-have-a-well-known-liberal-bias.html">liberal commentators</a> who have, over the years, taken that drollery at face value, suggesting that the numbers all point one way in the nation’s political debates. In fact, in plenty of areas, they don’t.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that Project 2025’s lengthy blueprint for the Trump administration makes no explicit recommendation to undo the government’s data-collection efforts. The blueprint is chock full of references to data-based decision-making, and in some areas, such as immigration enforcement, it urges the next administration to collect and share more data than its predecessors had.</p>

<p>But when an administration is making such a concerted effort to stifle assessments of government and society at large, it is hard not to conclude that it lacks confidence in the efficacy of its current national overhaul. As one dataset after another falls by the wayside, the nation’s policymakers are losing their ability to make evidence-based decisions, and the public is losing the ability to hold them accountable for their results. Even if a future administration seeks to resurrect some of the curtailed efforts, the 2025-29 hiatus will make trends harder to identify and understand.</p>

<p>Who knows if the country will be able to rebuild that measurement capacity in the future. For now, the loss is incalculable.</p>

<p>Just weeks after creating a $50 million tax credit to help families pay for private school tuition and homeschooling, Idaho has <a href="https://legislature.idaho.gov/sessioninfo/2025/legislation/S1142/">shut down</a> a program that helped tens of thousands of public school students pay for laptops, school supplies, tutoring and other educational expenses.</p>

<p>The Republican leading the push to defund Idaho’s Empowering Parents grants said it had nothing to do with the party’s decision to fund private schools. But the state’s most prominent conservative group, a strong supporter of the private school tax credit, drew the connection directly.</p>

<p>The Idaho Freedom Foundation, on its website, <a href="https://idahofreedom.org/senate-bill-1142-empowering-parents-program-repeal-1/">proposed adding the $30 million that fueled Empowering Parents</a> to the newly created tax credit, paying for an additional 6,000 private and homeschool students to join the 10,000 already expected to benefit from the program.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>The new voucher-style tax credits have major differences from the grants lawmakers killed.</p>

<p>The tax credits are off-limits to public school students, while the grants went predominantly to this group. And there’s limited state oversight on how the private education tax credits will be used, while the grants to public school families were only allowed to be spent with state-approved educational vendors.</p>

<p>Rep. Soñia Galaviz, a Democrat who works in a low-income public elementary school in Boise, condemned the plan to kill the grants in a speech to legislative colleagues.</p>

<p>“I have to go back to the families that I serve, the parents that I love, the kids that I teach, and say, ‘You no longer can get that additional math tutoring that you need,’” she said, “that ‘the state is willing to support other programs for other groups of kids, but not you.’”</p>


<p>When states steer public funds to private schools, well-off families benefit more than those in lower income brackets, as ProPublica <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/arizona-school-vouchers-esa-private-schools">has reported in Arizona</a>. The programs are pitched as enabling “school choice,” but in reality, <a href="https://nepc.colorado.edu/review/switchers">research has found</a> the money tends to benefit families that have already chosen private schools.</p>

<p>Idaho lawmakers passed such a program this year with the new tax credit, which some describe as a version of school “vouchers” that parents in other states spend on schools of their choosing.</p>

<p>The credit allows private and homeschool families to reduce their tax bills by $5,000 per child — $7,500 per student with disabilities — or get that much money from the state if they owe no taxes. Lower-income families have priority, and there’s no cap on how many credits each family can claim. The law says funds must go to traditional academic expenses like private school tuition or homeschool curricula and textbooks, plus a few other costs like transportation. But families don’t have to provide proof of how they spent the money unless they’re audited.</p>

<p>The Empowering Parents grant program that lawmakers repealed was open to students no matter where they learn, although state data shows at least 81% of the money went to public school students this academic year — more than 24,000 of them. It offered up to $1,000 per student, with lower-income families getting first dibs and a family limit of $3,000.</p>

<p>Idaho Gov. Brad Little created <a href="https://gov.idaho.gov/pressrelease/financial-support-for-k-12-education-grows-10-5-percent-during-pandemic/">a similar program in 2020 called Strong Families, Strong Students</a> with federal pandemic funds, to help families make the abrupt shift to remote learning. State lawmakers created the current program in 2022, also using one-time federal pandemic recovery money, and liked it so much they renewed it with ongoing state funding in 2023.</p>

<p>Charlene Bradley used the grant this school year to buy a laptop for her daughter, a fifth grader in Nampa School District. Before the purchase, Bradley’s daughter could use computers at school, but there was no way to do schoolwork at home, “besides my cell phone which we did have to use sometimes,” Bradley said in a Facebook message.</p>

<p>Debra Whiteley used it for home internet and a printer for her 12-year-old daughter, who attends public school in north-central Idaho. Whiteley’s daughter resisted doing projects that needed pictures or graphs. “Now when she has a project she can make a tri fold display that’s not all hand written and self drawn, which looking back on, I didn’t have a clue she may have been embarrassed about,” Whiteley said in a Facebook message.</p>

<p>Annie Coltrin used it to get “much needed” tutoring for her daughter, a sophomore in an agricultural community in southern Idaho. The grant paid for Coltrin’s daughter to receive math tutoring in person twice a week, which took her grade from a low D to a B+.</p>

<p>Such families were on the minds of education leaders like Jason Sevy when they advocated for preserving the Empowering Parents program this year.</p>

<p>Sevy, who chairs a rural public school district board in southwestern Idaho and is the Idaho School Boards Association’s president-elect, said families in his district used the Empowering Parents grants for backpacks and school supplies, or laptops they couldn’t afford otherwise.</p>

<p>“You’re looking at families with five kids that were only making $55,000 a year. Having that little extra money made a big difference,” Sevy said. “But it also closed that gap for these kids to feel like they were going to be able to keep up with everybody else.”</p>

<p>Few families in Sevy’s district will be able to use the state’s new tuition tax credits for private education, he said. A tiny residential school is the only private school operating in Sevy’s remote county. The next-closest options require a drive to the neighboring county, and Sevy worries those schools wouldn’t take English-language learners or children who need special education. (Unlike public schools, private schools can accept or reject students based on their own criteria.)</p>

<p>“This is the program that was able to help those groups of people, and they’re just letting it go away” to free up money for private schools, Sevy said.</p>


<p>The freshman legislator who sponsored the bill to end Empowering Parents is Sen. Camille Blaylock, a Republican from a small city west of Boise.</p>

<p>Blaylock’s stance is that the grants aren’t the proper role of government.</p>

<p>Speaking on the Senate floor in March, Blaylock highlighted the fact that the vast majority of the Empowering Parents money went to electronics — mostly computers, laptops and tablets.</p>

<p>“This program has drifted far from its original intent,” Blaylock said. “It’s turning into a technology slush fund, and if we choose to continue funding it, we are no longer empowering parents. We are creating entitlements.”</p>

<p>In an interview, Blaylock denied any desire to divert public school money to private education and said she was unaware the Idaho Freedom Foundation took that “unfortunate” position.</p>

<p>“The last thing I want is for this to be a ‘taking away from public schools to give to school choice,’ because that is not my intent at all,” Blaylock said.</p>

<p>She told the Senate’s education committee this year that her hope in ending the grants was to cut government spending by $30 million. But if the savings had to go somewhere, she’d want it to benefit other public school programs, especially in a year when lawmakers created the $50 million tax credit for private and homeschooling.</p>

<p>Regardless of how the $30 million in savings will be spent in the future, Blaylock’s assertion that the grants weren’t supposed to help families buy computers goes against what’s in the legislative record.</p>

<p>Lawmakers pitched Empowering Parents three years ago as a way to help lower-income students be on equal footing with their peers, with one legislator arguing that tablets and computers are such a part of education now that “without the ability of families to afford those devices, a student’s learning is substantially jeopardized.”</p>

<p>Republican Sen. Lori Den Hartog, opening debate on her bill to create Empowering Parents in 2022, said it was partly to address pandemic learning loss. “But,” she said, “it’s also a recognition of the ongoing needs that students in our state have, and that there is a potential different avenue to provide resources to those students.”</p>

<p>First in the list of eligible expenses Den Hartog spelled out: computer hardware, internet access, other technology. Then came textbooks, school materials, tutoring and everything else. (Den Hartog, who voted to repeal the program this year, did not respond to a request for comment.)</p>

<p>Killing the grants also went against the praise that Little, the state’s Republican governor, has showered on it. He has described the program as itself a form of “school choice,” touting how it helped low-income parents afford better education.</p>

<p>“The grants help families take charge of tools for their children’s education — things like computers and software, instructional materials and tutoring,” Little said in January 2023 when announcing his intent to make Empowering Parents permanent.</p>

<p>He called the grants “effective, popular and worthy of continued investment” because they “keep parents in the driver’s seat of their children’s education, as it should be.”</p>

<p>In the months before Idaho lawmakers voted to kill the program, <a href="https://gov.idaho.gov/pressrelease/empowering-parents-grants-growing-in-popularity-largely-benefit-low-income-families/">Little again cited Empowering Parents as a success story</a>, a way “to ensure Idaho families have the freedom and access to choose the best fit for their child’s unique education and learning needs.” He pointed out that the grants mainly went to public school students. He again touted it in his State of the State address in January, not as a temporary pandemic-era program but as “our popular” grant program “to support students’ education outside of the classroom.”</p>

<p>Nonetheless, the Idaho House and Senate both voted to kill the grant program by wide margins, and Little signed the bill on April 14.</p>

<p>Blaylock disagreed that the grant’s creators foresaw it would be used mostly for laptops and electronics. And, despite acknowledging state lawmakers decided to make it permanent, she disagrees that it was intended to be an ongoing program. She said public schools already get $36 million a year from the state to spend on technology, which they use to furnish computers students can take home, so families don’t need state money to buy more.</p>

<p>Little, in <a href="https://gov.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/transmittal_s1142aaH_2025.pdf">a letter explaining his decision to join lawmakers in killing the grants</a>, said he was “proud of the positive outcomes” from the program. But, he wrote: “Now that the pandemic is squarely in the rearview mirror and students have long been back in school, I agree with the Legislature that this program served its purpose.”</p>

<p>When looking back at how Empowering Parents was created, Sevy, the local school board chair, suspects it was a soft attempt “to get the foot in the door” toward vouchers, not purely an effort to meet the needs of all students.</p>

<p>He remembers telling Den Hartog that the program was helping low-income families in his district. “She was super-excited to hear that,” Sevy said. “It’s like, OK! And here we are two years later, just getting rid of it.”</p>

Title    : White Supremacist Terrorgram Network Allegedly Inspired Teen Accused of Killing Parents and Plotting Trump Assassination

<p>A Wisconsin teenager accused of murdering two family members and plotting to assassinate President Donald Trump was inspired by Terrorgram, a white supremacist network that operated on the Telegram messaging and social media platform for half a decade, according to federal court records.  </p>

<p>The Terrorgram community, which has been linked to around three dozen criminal cases around the globe, including at least three mass shootings, was profiled last month in <a href="https://www.propublica.org/series/the-rise-and-fall-of-terrorgram">stories</a> and a <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/the-rise-and-fall-of-terrorgram/">documentary</a> produced by ProPublica and FRONTLINE.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25898481-casap-affidavit/">court documents</a> allege that Nikita Casap, a 17-year-old from Waukesha, Wisconsin, wrote a three-page manifesto calling for the assassination of Trump in order to “foment a political revolution in the United States and ‘save the white race’ from ‘Jewish controlled politicians.’” </p>

<p>In his manifesto, Casap allegedly encouraged people to read the writings of <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/telegram-terrorgram-collective-bratislava-murders-neo-nazi-online-hate">Juraj Krajčík</a>, a longtime Terrogram figure who murdered two people in an attack on an LGBTQ+ bar in Bratislava, Slovakia, in 2022, according to the court records. Casap also allegedly recommended two publications produced by the Terrorgram Collective, a secretive group that produced alleged hit lists, videos and written publications — including instructions for building bombs and sabotaging critical infrastructure — and distributed them throughout the Terrorgram ecosystem.</p>

<p>Launched in 2019, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/rise-and-fall-terrorgram-inside-global-online-hate-network-frontline-telegram">Terrorgram was a constellation of scores of Telegram channels and chat groups</a> focused on inciting acts of white supremacist terrorism and anti-government sabotage. At the network’s peak, some Terrorgram channels drew thousands of followers. Over the past six months, however, the network has been disrupted as authorities in Canada, the U.S. and Europe have arrested key Terrorgram influencers and community members. </p>

<p>But the violence hasn’t stopped. </p>

<p>Casap in February allegedly shot and killed his mother, Tatiana Casap, and stepfather, Donald Mayer; stole their property; and fled in their Volkswagen Atlas, Waukesha County prosecutors say. He was arrested in Kansas. Prosecutors have charged the teen with two counts of first-degree homicide, as well as identity theft and other theft charges. He is expected to be arraigned on May 7, according to court records.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>A witness told local investigators that Casap “was in touch with a male in Russia through the Telegram app and they were planning to overthrow the U.S. government and assassinate President Trump,” <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25898468-casap-wi-criminal-complaint/">according to charging documents</a> in the Wisconsin case. </p>

<p>The newly unsealed federal court filings indicate that the FBI is investigating Casap in connection to the alleged assassination plot. </p>

<p>The bureau declined to comment on the matter.</p>

<p>Last fall, federal prosecutors accused two Americans of acting as leaders of the Terrorgram Collective and charged them with soliciting the murder of federal officials and a host of other terrorism-related offenses. The U.S. State Department has officially designated the Terrorgram Collective as a terrorist organization, as have officials in the United Kingdom and Australia. The two Americans have pleaded not guilty to the charges.</p>

<p>“Do absolutely anything you can that will lead to the collapse of America or any country you live in,” Casap allegedly wrote in his manifesto, according to an FBI affidavit. “This is the only way we can save the White race.”  </p>

<p>The teen’s writings and online postings that are cited in the affidavit indicate that he is a believer in militant accelerationism, a concept that has become increasingly popular with neo-Nazis and other right-wing extremists over the past decade. Militant accelerationists aim to speed the collapse of modern society through acts of spectacular violence; from the ruins of today’s democracies, they aim to build all-white ethno-states organized on fascist principles.</p>

<p>Matthew Kriner, executive director of the Institute for Countering Digital Extremism, a nonprofit think tank, called the alleged Casap plot unique. “It’s the first time we’re explicitly seeing an individual tie an accelerationist act or plot with the president of the United States as a means of collapsing society,” Kriner said. “I think what we have here is a fairly clear-cut case of an individual who is being groomed to take drastic terrorist action in an accelerationist manner.”</p>

<p>Casap’s public defender could not be reached for comment. </p>

<p>A Telegram spokesperson said, “Telegram supports the peaceful exchange of ideas; however, calls for violence are strictly prohibited by our Terms of Service and are removed proactively as well as in response to user reports."</p>

<p>A ProPublica and FRONTLINE review shows that Casap was recently active in at least five extremist Telegram channels or chat groups, including a Russian-language neo-Nazi chat in which posters uploaded detailed instructions for crafting explosives, poisons and improvised firearms. He was also a member of a chat group with more than 4,300 participants run by the Misanthropic Division, a global neo-Nazi organization. </p>

<p>Casap, according to the federal documents, also sought out information online about the Order of Nine Angles, a cult that blends Satanic concepts and Nazi ideology and has increasingly turned to Telegram to recruit and proselytize. </p>

<p>“This is a clear example of how Terrorgram continues to influence murder,” said Jennefer Harper, a researcher who studies online extremism. “Nikita was influenced online by an assortment of ideologies and groups that intersect with the Terrorgram ecosphere.”</p>

Title    : Trump Team Eyes Politically Connected Startup to Overhaul $700 Billion Government Payments Program

<p>Four days before Donald Trump’s inauguration, financial technology startup Ramp published a pitch for how to tackle wasteful government spending. In a 4,000-word <a href="https://research.contrary.com/deep-dive/efficiency-formula">blog post</a> titled “The Efficiency Formula,” Ramp’s CEO and one of its investors echoed ideas similar to those promoted by Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk: Federal programs were overrun by fraud, and commonsense business techniques could provide a quick fix.</p>

<p>Ramp sells corporate credit cards and artificial intelligence software for businesses to analyze spending. And while the firm appears to have no existing federal contracts, the post implied the government should consider hiring it. Just as Ramp helped businesses manage their budgets, the company “could do the same for a variety of government agencies,” according to the blog and company social media <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ramp_the-efficiency-formula-by-contrary-research-activity-7285748862005198848-lcQW/">posts</a>.</p>

<p>It didn’t take long for Ramp to find a willing audience. Within Trump’s first three months in office, its executives scored at least four private meetings with the president’s appointees at the General Services Administration, which oversees major federal contracting. Some of the meetings were organized by the nation’s top procurement officer, Josh Gruenbaum, commissioner of the Federal Acquisition Service.</p>

<p>GSA is eying Ramp to get a piece of the government’s $700 billion internal expense card program, known as SmartPay. In recent weeks, Trump appointees at GSA have been moving quickly to tap Ramp for a charge card pilot program worth up to $25 million, sources told ProPublica, even as Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency highlights the multitudes of contracts it has canceled across federal agencies.</p>

<p>Founded six years ago, Ramp is backed by some of the most powerful figures in Silicon Valley. One is Peter Thiel, the billionaire venture capitalist who was one of Trump’s earliest supporters in the tech world and who spent millions aiding Vice President JD Vance’s Ohio Senate run. Thiel’s firm, Founders Fund, has invested in seven separate rounds of funding for Ramp, according to data from PitchBook. Last year Thiel said there was “no one better positioned” to build products at the intersection of AI and finance.</p>

<p>To date, the company has raised about $2 billion in venture capital, according to startup tracking website Crunchbase, much of it from firms with ties to Trump and Musk. Ramp’s other major financial backers include Keith Rabois of Khosla Ventures; Thrive Capital, founded by Joshua Kushner, the brother of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner; and 8VC, a firm run by Musk allies.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>The special attention Gruenbaum paid to Ramp raised flags inside and outside the agency. “This goes against all the normal contracting safeguards that are set up to prevent contracts from being awarded based on who you know,” said Scott Amey, the general counsel with the bipartisan Project on Government Oversight. He said career civil servants should lead the process to pick the best choice for taxpayers.</p>

<p>A senior GSA official, who requested anonymity for fear of retribution, said the high level attention Ramp received was unusual, especially before a bid had been made public. “You don’t want to give this impression that leadership has already decided the winner somehow.”</p>

<p>GSA told ProPublica it “refutes any suggestion of unfair or preferential contracting practices,” with a spokesperson adding that the “credit card reform initiative has been well known to the public in an effort to address waste, fraud, and abuse.”</p>

<p>Ramp did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Rabois, one of Ramp’s earliest investors, is part of an influential group of tech titans known as the “PayPal Mafia.” Leaders of the early payments company include several influential players surrounding the Trump administration, including Musk and Thiel. Rabois and his husband, Jacob Helberg, hosted a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/11/jd-vance-wall-street-trump-election.html">fundraiser that pulled in upwards of $1 million for Trump’s 2024 campaign</a>, according to media reports. Trump has nominated Helberg for a senior role at the State Department.</p>

<p>Rabois sits on Ramp’s board of directors. He has said he had no plans to join the Trump administration, instead <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FicZVY6A9V8&amp;t=289s">telling CNBC</a>: “I have ideas, I can spoon-feed them to the right people.” He told ProPublica his comments to CNBC were about big-picture policy ideas and that he had “no involvement in any government-related initiatives for the company.” Ramp “could be a great choice for any government that wants to improve its efficiencies,” Rabois added.</p>

<p>Helberg said he has no involvement “in anything related to Ramp whatsoever.”</p>

<p>Thrive Capital, Kushner’s firm, did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Thiel did not provide a comment. 8VC did not respond to a request for comment, nor did the White House or Musk; previously, Musk has said “I’ll recuse myself” if conflict-of-interest issues arise.</p>

<p>Ramp’s meetings with Gruenbaum — who comes from private equity firm KKR and has no prior government experience — came at an opportune moment. GSA will decide by year’s end whether to extend the SmartPay contract, and preparations are afoot for the next generation of the program. SmartPay has been worth hundreds of millions of dollars in fees for the financial institutions that currently operate it, U.S. Bank and Citibank.</p>

<p>Gruenbaum and acting GSA administrator Stephen Ehikian entered the agency with a strong belief that SmartPay and other government payment programs were rife with fraud or waste, causing huge losses, sources within GSA say — an idea echoed in Ramp’s January memo.</p>

<p>Yet both GOP and Democratic budget experts, as well as former GSA officials, describe that view as ill-informed. SmartPay, which provides Visa and Mastercard charge cards to government employees, enables the federal workforce to purchase office supplies and equipment, book travel and pay for gas.</p>

<p>The cards typically are used to fund travel and purchases up to $10,000.</p>

<p>“SmartPay is the lifeblood of the government,” said former GSA commissioner Sonny Hashmi, who oversaw the program. “It’s a well-run program that solves real world problems … with exceptional levels of oversight and fraud prevention already baked in.”</p>

<p>Jessica Riedl, a GOP budget expert at the conservative Manhattan Institute think tank, said the notion that there was significant fraud in the charge card technology was far-fetched. She had criticized waste in government credit card programs before the latest SmartPay system was implemented in 2018.</p>

<p>“This was a huge problem about 20-25 years ago,” she said. “In the past 15 years, there have been new controls put into government credit card purchases.”</p>

<p>A <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-17-276">2017 audit of the program</a> by the Government Accountability Office concluded there was “little evidence of potential fraud” in SmartPay small purchases, though it found documentation errors. More recent government audits found some instances where officials did not always use anti-fraud tools.</p>

<p>GSA’s new leaders are convinced SmartPay is entirely broken, a view they shared in private meetings, sources said. In February, they put a temporary $1 limit on government cards and severely restricted the number of cardholders, choking off funds to workers in the field.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/doge-elon-musk-spending-cuts-federal-workers/">Chaos ensued across the government</a>, news organizations reported: Staff at the National Institutes of Health were reportedly unable to purchase materials for experiments, Federal Aviation Administration workers worried they would be unable to pay for travel to test systems in the field, and National Park Service employees could not travel to oversee road maintenance projects.</p>

<p>At the time, GSA <a href="https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/newsroom/news-releases/statement-regarding-recent-reporting-about-the-gsa-smartpayr-program-02212025">released a statement</a> saying the limitations were “risk mitigation best practice” and internally began moving to revamp SmartPay.</p>

$25 Million Opportunity
<p>Ramp’s first bite of the SmartPay business could come through a pilot program worth up to $25 million that GSA announced several weeks after agency leadership began meeting with the company.</p>

<p>At the tail end of the Biden administration, GSA had sent out a request for information, or RFI, seeking industry input about how to improve the next iteration of SmartPay. But some industry players who submitted responses said they did not hear back from the government. Instead, GSA started meeting with Ramp.</p>

<p>GSA put out a new RFI for the pilot program on March 20, 2025, leaving it open for less than seven business days.</p>

<p>John Weiler, co-founder of the nonprofit research group the IT Acquisition Advisory Council, said such a short window appeared unusual. “A week is nothing, it gives the impression they had already picked the winner,” said Weiler, who has worked with Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley to investigate IT contracting issues.</p>

<p>Ramp is the clear-cut “favorite,” to secure this work, one source inside GSA and another former official told ProPublica. The winner has not yet been announced.</p>

<p>Procurement experts told ProPublica that consulting with industry leaders before a major overhaul is good practice — but that the fact-finding process must be evenhanded and led by professional contracting officers.</p>

<p>The GSA spokesperson said that “any and all communications with potential vendors, of which there were multiple, has been a part of market research in order to provide the best solution for American taxpayers.” The agency declined to answer questions about whether Ramp had already been chosen internally for SmartPay work.</p>

<p>The pilot program is unique because it uses a special GSA purchasing authority known as commercial solutions opening. This process has been used by the Pentagon to help speed up the acquisition of products for fighters in armed conflict zones. The designation means the chosen contractor can be selected faster and without the same level of controls.</p>

<p>It’s not clear how Ramp originally secured private meetings with GSA leaders. Nor is it clear if Ramp will ultimately take over the entire SmartPay contract from Citibank and U.S. Bank. Spokespeople for U.S. Bank and Citibank declined to comment.</p>

<p>It is clear that Ramp has never had a client like the federal government. The only public-sector partner <a href="https://ramp.com/customers">listed on its webpage</a> is a charter school network in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>

<p>Still, even before the RFI was publicly announced, Ramp had begun reaching out to contacts in the payment industry asking about the special bank identification numbers required to process government payments, said an industry source. Such steps, two former GSA officials said, were another sign that Ramp was preparing to work on the program.</p>

<p>Ramp’s meetings with GSA come as the agency is poised to take on a more significant role in spending decisions across government. The same day the SmartPay pilot was announced, <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/eliminating-waste-and-saving-taxpayer-dollars-by-consolidating-procurement/">Trump issued an </a><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/eliminating-waste-and-saving-taxpayer-dollars-by-consolidating-procurement/">executive</a><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/eliminating-waste-and-saving-taxpayer-dollars-by-consolidating-procurement/"> order</a> that seeks to centralize much of government procurement inside of GSA. The DOGE initiative has been effectively headquartered out of the agency — staffers have <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/06/doge-federal-office-bedrooms-00216863">installed beds and dressers</a> for overnight stays in the building, and <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/doge-leadership-elon-musk-amy-gleason-trump-ethics-conflict-of-interest">Musk’s right-hand man </a><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/doge-leadership-elon-musk-amy-gleason-trump-ethics-conflict-of-interest">Steve Davis</a> is a key adviser to the agency’s leadership.</p>

<p>The SmartPay contract negotiation has so far flown under the radar. But changes to the credit card program could further transform daily life for federal employees and fundamentally change how agencies operate. It also represents a giant business opportunity.</p>

<p>“There’s a lot of money to be made by a new company coming in here,” said Hashmi, the former GSA official. “But you have to ask: What is the problem that’s being solved?”</p>

Title    : Wisconsin’s Name-Change Law Raises Safety Risks for Transgender People

                        <p>This article was produced for ProPublica’s Local Reporting Network in partnership with <a href="https://wisconsinwatch.org/">Wisconsin Watch</a>. <a href="https://www.propublica.org/newsletters/dispatches">Sign up for Dispatches</a> to get stories like this one as soon as they are published.</p>

        

    


        
                        <p><strong>Update, April 18, 2025:</strong> After this story was published, the family of a transgender boy who changed his legal name at 15 years old learned a judge approved their request to retroactively seal his name-change documents. Wisconsin state Sen. Melissa Ratcliff and other Democrats have also introduced the bill that would eliminate the publication requirement for transgender people, so long as they can prove they’re not avoiding debt or a criminal record.</p>

        

    
      
  



                    
<p>In 2022, after living as a boy and going by a new name for several years, a 15-year-old from Madison, Wisconsin, wanted to make it official. Like most teenagers, he dreamed of getting his driver’s license, and his family wanted his government identification to reflect who he really was.</p>

<p>But Wisconsin law has a caveat: He would have to publish his old, feminine name and new name in the local newspaper for three weeks — essentially announcing to the world that he is transgender.</p>

<p>In many instances, if he had committed a crime, the law would afford him privacy as a minor. But not as a transgender teenager changing his name.</p>

<p>His parents worry the public notice now poses a risk as President Donald Trump has <a href="https://19thnews.org/2025/03/trump-anti-trans-executive-orders/">attacked transgender rights</a>, asserted that U.S. policy recognizes only two sexes and described efforts to support transgender people as “child abuse.” The publication requirements endanger the community, lawyers working with trans people say, by creating a de facto dataset of likely transgender people that vigilantes and even the government could use for firing, harassment or violence.</p>

<p>Transgender people are over four times more likely to be victims of violence, <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/ncvs-trans-victimization/">research shows.</a> Most transgender people and their families agreed to be interviewed for this story only if they weren’t named, citing safety concerns.</p>

<p>“Publication requirements really leave folks open and vulnerable to discrimination and to harassment more than they already are,” said Arli Christian, senior policy counsel at the American Civil Liberties Union. “It can put people at risk of violence and blatant discrimination simply because of who they are.”</p>

<p>Wisconsin’s legal process stems from a <a href="https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/1858/related/acts/140.pdf">167-year-old law</a>, one of many statutes across the country that Christian said were intended to keep people from escaping debts or criminal records. Changing one’s name through marriage is a separate process that does not require publication in a paper.</p>

<p>Although the right to change one’s legal name exists in every state, the effort and risk required to exercise it vary. Less than half of states require people to publicize their name changes in some or all cases, <a href="https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/identity_documents">according to</a> the Movement Advancement Project, a think tank that tracks voting and LGBTQ+ rights.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>Wisconsin law grants confidentiality only if a person can prove it’s more likely than not that publication “could endanger” them. But the statute does not define what that means. For years, some judges interpreted that to include psychological abuse or bullying, or they accepted statistics documenting discrimination and violence against transgender people nationwide. </p>

<p>In 2023, however, a state appeals court set a stricter standard after a trans teenager was denied a confidential name change in Brown County, home to Green Bay. The teen said he had endured years of bullying, in which peers called him slurs and beat him up. Court records show the Brown County judge asserted that publishing the teen’s name wouldn’t expose him to further harm because his harassers already knew he was transgender.</p>

<p>The teen argued that a public process would create a record available to people he met in the future. While the appeals court conceded a “reasonable judge” could agree, it found the Brown County judge had not improperly exercised her discretion in denying the request. Crucially, the appeals court determined that “endanger” meant only physical harm. The case wasn’t appealed to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.</p>
        
    
                        

    
        

                            
                                                        
                                                        
                                

            Both of these trans girls living in Wisconsin requested the confidential name-change process after the 2024 presidential election. First image: A 14-year-old likes cuddling her cat, playing video games and practicing piano. Second image: A 12-year-old shares her artwork.

<p>The combination of Wisconsin’s public requirement, the restrictive ruling and the Trump administration’s anti-trans policies has dissuaded at least one person from going through with a name change.</p>

<p>J.J Koechell, a 20-year-old LGBTQ+ advocate from suburban Milwaukee, tried to change his name in November but decided against it after a judge denied his request for confidentiality, ordering him to publish his change in the local paper and create a public court record if he wanted to proceed. </p>

<p>“That’s already dangerous,” Koechell said of a public process, “given our political atmosphere, with an administration that’s trying to erase trans people from existence completely, or saying that they don’t exist, or that there’s something wrong with them.”</p>

<p>At the end of March, Wisconsin Democrats announced plans to introduce a bill that would eliminate the publication requirement for transgender people, so long as they can prove they’re not avoiding debt or a criminal record. Republicans, who control the Legislature, will decide whether it will receive a hearing or vote. </p>

<p>There has been a push in some states to make it easier and safer for transgender people to update their legal documents. <a href="https://www.legislature.mi.gov/Bills/Bill?ObjectName=2023-HB-5300">Michigan</a> and <a href="https://www.wcia.com/illinois-capitol-news/new-illinois-law-effective-this-year-will-streamline-process-for-changing-names/#:~:text=ILLINOIS%20(WCIA)%20%E2%80%94%20A%20new,JB%20Pritzker%20late%20last%20week.&amp;text=It%20repeals%20the%20requirement%20to%20publish%20a%20public%20name%20change%20notice.">Illinois</a> laws removing publication requirements took effect earlier this year. And a California lawmaker <a href="https://www.ebar.com/story/337294">introduced</a> a bill that would retroactively seal all transition-related court records.</p>

<p>Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, did not respond to emails and a phone call to his office seeking comment. Wisconsin Watch and ProPublica sought comment from four other Republican leaders in the Assembly and Senate. Of the two whose offices responded, a staffer for Assembly Majority Leader Tyler August, R-Walworth, said, “It doesn’t look like something we’d consider a priority,” and a staffer for Senate Assistant Majority Leader Dan Feyen, R-Fond du Lac, said he was not available for comment.</p>

<p>Asked about the safety concerns people raised, a White House spokesperson said, “President Trump has vowed to defend women from gender ideology extremism and restore biological truth to the Federal government.”</p>

No Exceptions for Minors
<p>Wisconsin’s law requires a transgender person to publish the details of their identity to change their name whether they are an adult or a child. The notice requirement makes no distinction based on age.</p>

<p>This is less privacy than the legal system typically affords young people, confirmed Cary Bloodworth, who directs a family law clinic at the University of Wisconsin Law School. Bloodworth said both child welfare and juvenile courts tend to keep records confidential for a number of reasons, including that what happens in a person’s youth will follow them for a lifetime. </p>

<p>“I certainly think having a higher level of privacy for kids is a good thing,” Bloodworth said, adding that she thinks the publication requirement is unnecessary for people of any age.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            An 11-year old trans girl recently went through the name-change process. She enjoys playing with her dog and swimming, and her mom describes her as a “major science geek.”

<p>A mom living near the Wisconsin-Illinois border whose 11-year-old daughter recently went through the name-change process said these proceedings should automatically be private for children.</p>

<p>“The fact that we still have to fight to get something as simple as a confidential name change for a minor who is obviously not running away from criminal or debt charges is just so frustrating and overwhelming,” she said. </p>

<p>The judge deciding their case seemed reluctant to grant confidentiality at first, questioning whether her daughter was being threatened physically, she said. The judge granted the confidential change. But the family remains shaken. </p>

<p>“We live just in constant terror of the wrong person finding out that we have an 11-year-old trans child,” she said. “All it takes is one wrong person getting that information, and what we could end up going through, becoming a target, is horrifying.” </p>

<p>Right before the pandemic, a teenager told her parents she was transgender. She spent much of that first year of her transition at home, attending virtual school like the rest of her peers in the Madison school district. She came out to only a few friends and wanted to keep her gender identity private, so she kept her camera off and skipped her high school graduation. </p>

<p>When she decided to legally change her name, the prospect of publicizing her transition terrified her, according to her mom.</p>

<p>“I explained to her that it’s in tiny, tiny print, and it’s in some page of the paper that no one is going to read,” her mom said. “But it felt to her like she was just standing out there in public with a ‘TRANS’ sign on her.”</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            A trans teenager was terrified of the public name-change requirement. She loves playing board games, reading and spending time with friends and her partner.

<p>While fewer people read physical newspapers these days, much of their content gets published online and is easily searchable. The court case, too, becomes a public record that is stored online and sometimes aggregated by other websites that show up at the top of search results. </p>

<p>The parents of the then-15-year-old boy who changed his name before getting his driver’s license discovered that happened to their son. When anyone — say, a prospective employer — searches the young man’s name, one of the first results shows his old name and outs him as trans.</p>

<p>“This is what somebody would use as their first judgment of him,” his mom said. “We certainly don’t want that to be something that people would use to rule him out for a job, or whatever it is he might be doing.” </p>

<p>Like <a href="https://www.mapresearch.org/equality-maps/non_discrimination_laws/public-accommodations">many other states</a>, Wisconsin <a href="https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality_maps/profile_state/WI">does not have laws</a> that ban discrimination against transgender people in credit and lending practices or in public spaces like stores, restaurants, parks, doctor’s offices and hotels. However, Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, issued an executive order in 2019 banning transgender discrimination in state employment, contracting and public services.</p>

<p>After Trump took office again and began issuing executive orders attacking trans rights, the boy’s family started to investigate how they could retroactively seal the court records related to the name change. It wouldn’t change what was in the newspaper, but it could help them remove the online records. The court records also contain sensitive information like their home address that someone could use to harass them.</p>

<p>A friend who was a retired attorney helped their son craft an affidavit describing his experiences. His mom read from it during an interview. “‘Because of recent political events, I fear violence —’” she said before breaking off. “Oh God, I hate even reading this. ‘I fear violence, harassment, retribution because of my status as a transgender person.’”</p>

<p>Her son, who is now 18, shared a statement over email. </p>

<p>“At this moment in time I’m probably more scared about being a trans person than I ever have been before, with the public record if you have my first and last name you can easily find my deadname and therefore find out I’m trans,” he said. “I would love to say that I feel safe and valued in our society but unfortunately I can’t, at times I feel that my personhood is being stripped away under this government.”</p>
        
    
                        

    
        

                            
                                                        
                                                        
                                

            A trans teenager officially changed his name and now fears violence because that information is public. He enjoys doing puzzles with his family and creating metal artwork.

<p>Anne Daugherty-Leiter, who has guided transgender clients and their families through the name-change process as board president of <a href="https://www.translawhelp.com/">Trans Law Help Wisconsin</a>, said where a person lives in Wisconsin, and therefore what court they must petition, affects their likelihood of getting a confidential change.</p>

<p>Confidentiality is important, she said, because of how the state handles changes to birth certificates. Wisconsin birth certificates that are issued through a confidential name change show only the new name. But if a person has to announce their name change publicly, birth certificates are amended to list both the person’s old and new names. Any time the person has to use that document, at the DMV or while getting a loan, it outs them, she said.</p>

“This Is Not Who I Am”
<p>Koechell, a trans man and LGBTQ+ activist, was unwilling to go through with the name-change process after being denied confidentiality by a judge late last year.</p>

<p>Koechell lives in Waukesha County, a Republican stronghold where multiple schools have enacted policies critics have called anti-LGBTQ+.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            A judge denied J.J Koechell’s confidential name change with an order that referred to the trans man as “she” and “her.”

<p>In a letter to the judge, Koechell wrote that people had sent him multiple threats and posted his family members’ addresses online, all for “being an advocate and being transgender openly in my community.” </p>

<p>“I do not want to publish my deadname for people to use against me,” he said in an interview, using a <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-news/deadname-meaning-trans-rights-misgender-definition-rcna126852">term common among transgender people</a> to refer to their birth names. “I don’t see a reason why people who are not particularly fond of me wouldn’t show up at a hearing like that and try and cause trouble.” </p>

<p>Court records show the judge denied Koechell’s confidentiality request and his request to reconsider. The judge’s order referred to Koechell, a trans man with a masculine voice and beard, as “she” and “her.”</p>

<p>Koechell decided the public process wasn’t worth the risk. But it’s hard, he said, to move through life with his old identification.</p>

<p>“When I go to a new doctor or new appointment or something, then that’s the name on my chart, and then I get called that in a waiting room full of people, and it’s super uncomfortable. I just want to disappear,” Koechell said. “Then eventually, I have to correct the doctors, and I’m like, ‘Hey, just to let you know, I don’t go by that name. This is not who I am.’”</p>

<p>Data from the <a href="https://transequality.org/sites/default/files/2024-02/2022%20USTS%20Early%20Insights%20Report_FINAL.pdf">latest</a> U.S. Transgender Survey found that 22% of people who had to show an ID that did not match their identity experienced some form of negative consequence, including verbal harassment, discrimination or physical violence. </p>

<p>If the U.S. Senate passes the SAVE Act, which would require voters to prove citizenship with a passport or birth certificate, those consequences could include disenfranchisement. Transgender people who can’t change the name on their birth certificate or passport <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/the-save-act-could-keep-millions-of-transgender-americans-from-voting/">would be ineligible to vote</a>, according to the liberal think tank Center for American Progress.</p>

<p>U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, a Texas Republican and chief sponsor of the bill, <a href="https://roy.house.gov/media/press-releases/icymi-roy-op-ed-federalist-senators-dont-fall-hillary-clintons-desperate-0">has said</a> the legislation directs states to create a process for citizens with a “name discrepancy” to register. “No one will be unable to vote because of a name change,” he said.</p>

<p>After Trump won in November, Trace Schlax, a 40-year-old IT project manager, decided to expedite changing his gender marker on his passport, figuring he could update his name later in state court. </p>

<p>“It matters,” Schlax said. He loves to travel but has encountered extra scrutiny from airport security with outdated documents. “I get comments from TSA when I go through to travel domestically, about my hair, about how I look. I get extra pat-downs."</p>

<p>He sent his application in early December and crossed his fingers. He received it back in February, rejected. By that time, Trump had issued an executive order banning trans people from changing the gender markers on their passports.</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p>Schlax decided to continue updating what records he could, like his birth certificate and driver’s license. He worries about having conflicting documents. Will he get accused of fraud? Will he have trouble flying? </p>

<p>But in the end, he decided it was still important to change his name and update his license to improve his day-to-day experience. </p>

<p>And he decided to go about it publicly. It felt less painful, he said, to accept the risks rather than detail his personal, traumatic experiences to a judge only to have them decide he hadn’t endured sufficient danger. </p>

<p>“Me changing my name and my gender marker affects absolutely no one but me,” said Schlax, who has a court date to change his name in late April. “Why does this have to be so hard? Why do I have to prove myself so hard?”</p>

<p>Within hours of taking office, President Donald Trump declared an emergency on the U.S.-Mexico border, giving him authority to unilaterally spend billions on immigration enforcement and wall construction. He has since <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/02/11/white-house-congress-border-funding-reconciliation">reportedly urged Congress</a> to authorize an additional $175 billion for border security, far exceeding what was spent during his first term.</p>

<p>In the coming months, border towns in Texas and Arizona will receive more grants to fund and equip police patrols. New wall construction projects will fill border communities with workers who eat at restaurants, shop in stores and rent space in RV parks. And National Guard deployments will add to local economies.</p>

<p>But if the president asked Sandra Fuentes what the biggest need in her community on the Texas-Mexico border is, the answer would be safe drinking water, not more border security. And if Trump put the same question to Jose Grijalva, the Arizona mayor would say a hospital for his border city, which has struggled without one for a decade.</p>

<p>Although billions of state and federal dollars flow into the majority-Latino communities along the nearly 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border, many remain among the poorest places in the nation. In many towns, unemployment is significantly higher and income much lower than their interior counterparts, with limited access to health care, underfunded infrastructure and lagging educational attainment. Security walls are erected next to neighborhoods without running water, and National Guard units deploy to towns without paved roads and hospitals. </p>

<p>By some estimates, about 30,000 border residents in Texas lack access to reliable drinking water, among more than a million statewide. For 205,000 people living along Arizona’s border with Mexico, the nearest full-service hospital is hours away.</p>

<p>Such struggles aren’t confined to the border. But the region offers perhaps the most striking disparity between the size of federal and state governments’ investment there and how little it’s reflected in the quality of life of residents.</p>

<p>“The border security issue takes up all the oxygen and a lot of the resources in the room,” said state Rep. Mary González, a Democrat from El Paso County who has sponsored bills to address water needs. “It leaves very little space for all the other priorities, specifically water and wastewater infrastructure, because most people don’t understand what it’s like turning your faucet and there’ll be no water.”</p>

<p>Here’s how residents in two border towns, Del Rio, Texas, and Douglas, Arizona, experience living in places where the government always seems ready to spend on border security while stubborn obstacles to their communities’ well-being remain.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            Nearly a fifth of the nearly 50,000 residents in Val Verde County, Texas, live in poverty, compared with the state’s 14% average.
    
    
    
    

    

        
    
                    

<p>When Cierra Flores gives her daughter a bath at their home in Del Rio, she has to keep a close eye on the water level of the outdoor tank that supplies her house. Like any 6-year-old, her daughter likes to play in the running water. But Flores doesn’t have the luxury of leaving the tap open. When the tank runs dry, the household is out of water. That means not washing dishes, doing laundry or flushing the toilet until the trip can be made to get more water.</p>

<p>Flores lives on a ranch in Escondido Estates, a neighborhood where many residents have gone decades without running water. Flores’ family has a well on their property. But during the summer and prolonged droughts, as the region is now experiencing, their well runs dry.</p>

<p>At those times, the family relies on a neighbor who has a more dependable well and is willing to sell water. Flores’ husband makes hourlong trips twice on weekends to fill the family’s water tank. Their situation has felt even more tenuous lately, as her neighbor’s property was listed for sale, prompting worries about whether they’ll continue to have access to his well.</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p>“I have no idea where we would go here if that well wasn’t there,” Flores said. “It’s frustrating that we don’t have basic resources, especially in a place where they know when the summer comes it doesn’t rain. It doesn’t rain, we don’t have water.”</p>

<p>Val Verde County, where Del Rio is located, is three times the size of Rhode Island and hours from a major city. About a fifth of its nearly 50,000 residents live in poverty, a rate nearly twice the national average. Some live in <a href="https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/cdbg-colonias/colonias-history/">colonias</a> — rural communities along the U.S.-Mexico border, including illegal subdivisions that lack access to water, sewers or adequate housing.</p>

<p>The county has worked for years to bring water to residents, piecing together state and federal grants. Yet <a href="https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/divisions/colonias-database">about 2,000 people</a> — more than 4% of the county’s population — still lack running water, according to a database kept by the Texas Office of the Attorney General. For those residents, it means showering at fitness centers and doing the dishes once a week with water from plastic jugs.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            Some neighborhoods along the Mexican border on the outskirts of Del Rio, such as the area where Cierra Flores and her 6-year-old daughter, Olivia, live, still lack infrastructure like paved roads and access to safe drinking water.
    
    
    
    

    

        
    
                    
<p>In the early 1990s, then-Gov. Ann Richards, a Democrat, toured some of the state’s colonias along the border to assess the living conditions. After stepping into the mud on an unpaved street, she’s said to have been so moved by the scene that she told a staffer, “Whatever they want, give it to them.”</p>

<p>Fuentes, a community organizer, likes to tell that story because it drives home how long residents have fought for water and other improvements but been stymied by state and local politics and limited funds.</p>

<p>“It’s going to be an uphill battle, but we are going to keep on battling,” she said. “What else is there to do?”</p>
        
    
                    
<p>Over the past 30 years, the state has provided more than $1 billion in grants and loans to bring drinking water and wastewater treatment to colonias and other economically distressed areas. Texas 2036, a nonpartisan public policy think tank, <a href="https://texas2036.org/posts/testimony-1b-to-water-infrastructure-fund-is-a-welcome-first-step/">estimates Texas needs nearly $154 billion</a> by 2050 to meet water demands across the state amid population growth, the ongoing drought and aging infrastructure. </p>

<p>Texas state leaders said they are committed to investing in water projects and infrastructure. Gov. Greg Abbott’s office said he is calling on the Legislature to dedicate $1 billion a year for 10 years and is looking forward to working with lawmakers “to ensure Texans have a safe, reliable water supply for the next 50 years.” </p>

<p>Kim Carmichael, a spokesperson for Texas House Speaker Dustin Burrows, a Republican from Lubbock, said, “Texas is at a critical juncture with its water supply, and every lawmaker recognizes the need to act decisively and meaningfully invest to further secure our water future.” The Texas House’s base budget proposes $2.5 billion for water infrastructure.</p>

<p>One of the challenges — at the federal and state level — is that infrastructure needs often exceed available funds, said <a href="https://www.rcap.org/our-people/">Olga Morales-Pate</a>, chief executive officer of Rural Community Assistance Partnership, a national network of nonprofits that works with rural communities on access to safe drinking water and wastewater issues. “So it becomes a competitive process: Who gets there faster, who has a better application, who is shovel ready to get those funding opportunities out?” she said.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            Community organizer Karen Gonzalez is frustrated that residents of the Del Rio area still lack water access while state leaders focus on border security.
    
    
    
    

    

        
    
                    
<p>The plight of people without water often gets overlooked, said Karen Gonzalez, an organizer who used to work with Fuentes. Even though she grew up in Del Rio, it wasn’t until she started to work with the community that she learned some county residents didn’t have water.</p>

<p>“Every person that I come across that I tell that we’re working this issue is like, ‘There’s people that don’t have water?’” she said. “It’s not something that is known.” </p>

<p>Unlike border security, which is constantly in the spotlight.</p>

<p>During his inauguration, Trump praised Abbott as a “leader of the pack” on border security. In 2021, Abbott launched Operation Lone Star, a multibillion-dollar effort aimed at curbing illegal immigration and drug trafficking. As part of the operation, the state has awarded Val Verde County and the city of Del Rio more than $10 million in grants, state data obtained by The Texas Tribune shows.</p>

<p>A state-funded border wall that has gone up in the county a short distance from the Rio Grande stretches in fits and starts, including next to a neighborhood without running water. As of November, <a href="https://apps.texastribune.org/features/2024/texas-border-wall-greg-abbott-landowners/">about 5 miles</a> of it had cost at least $162 million, according to the Tribune. The state Legislature’s proposed budget <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2025/03/25/texas-senate-budget-approval/">includes $6.5 billion</a> to maintain “current border security operations.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, organizers, elected officials and residents say state and federal programs to fund water infrastructure will continue to fall short of the need. Last year, the state fund created by lawmakers in 1989 to help underserved areas access drinking water had $200 million in applications for assistance and only $100 million in available funding.</p>

<p>When grants are awarded, water projects can take years to complete because of increasing costs and unforeseen construction difficulties — like hitting unexpected bedrock while laying pipe, said Val Verde County Judge Lewis Owens. Project delays — some of them, Owens acknowledged, the county’s fault — impede the ability to get future grants.</p>

<p>Organizers like Fuentes and Karen Gonzalez said their frustration with the slow progress on water has grown as they’ve watched the border wall go up and billions more dollars spent to deploy state troopers and the National Guard to aid federal border security officers.</p>

<p>“It’s just infuriating,” Karen Gonzalez said. She said she hopes elected officials “focus on what our actual border community needs are. And for us, I feel like it’s not border security.”</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

    
        
            
            
            

            Sections of the border wall are being built as part of Gov. Greg Abbott’s Operation Lone Star on the outskirts of Del Rio, near neighborhoods without access to safe drinking water.

<p>As paramedics loaded her 8-year-old son into a helicopter in the Arizona border town of Douglas, Nina Nelson did her best to reassure him. Days earlier, Jacob and his father had been riding ATVs on their ranch in far southeastern Arizona, along the U.S.-Mexico border. Dust irritated Jacob’s lungs, and over the next few days his breathing deteriorated until Nelson could see him fight for every breath.</p>

<p>He needed care that isn’t available in Douglas, a town of about 15,000. And he would have to make the trip without her.</p>

<p>“Buddy, you’re gonna be OK,” she recalled telling him. She knew it would take more than twice as long to drive the 120 miles to Tucson and the nearest hospital that could provide the care he needed. “I’m gonna be racing up there. I’ll be there. I’m gonna find you,” she said.</p>

<p>Douglas lost its hospital nearly a decade ago. Southeast Arizona Medical Center had struggled financially for years and by 2015 was staffed by out-of-state doctors. When it ran afoul of federal rules too many times, <a href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/arizona/2015/07/31/douglas-community-hospital-closure/30976683/">jeopardizing patient safety</a>, the government pulled its ability to bill Medicare and Medicaid and it closed within a week.</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p>As her son’s breathing took a turn for the worse, Nelson considered the variables everyone in Douglas confronts in a medical emergency. Should she go to the town’s stand-alone emergency room, which treats only the most basic maladies? Drive the half hour to Bisbee or an hour to Sierra Vista for slightly higher levels of care? Or could Jacob endure the two hours it takes to drive to Tucson?</p>

<p>“That is the kind of game you play: ‘How much time do I think I have?’” Nelson said.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            Nina Nelson’s son Jacob has been transported twice by helicopter to get medical care because Douglas lacks a full-service hospital.
    
    
    
    

    

        
    
                    
<p>Arizona hasn’t been as aggressive as Texas in funding border security. But when concerns about the border surge, money often follows.</p>

<p>In 2021, the state created the Border Security Fund and allocated $55 million to it. A year later, then-Gov. Doug Ducey asked state lawmakers for $50 million for border security. They gave him more than 10 times that amount, including $335 million for a border wall. The measure was proposed by Sen. David Gowan, a Republican who represents Douglas. In October 2022, crews began stacking shipping containers along the border in Cochise County, where Douglas is located. Gowan’s spokesperson said he wasn’t available for comment.</p>

<p>The container wall wasn’t effective. <a href="https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/migrants-at-arizona-border-unhindered-by-shipping-container-wall">Migrants slipped through</a> gaps between containers, and a section toppled over. When the federal government sued, claiming the construction was trespassing on federal land, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/arizona-mexico-border-shipping-containers-9c39f308e027ac1951c1eaa7cc052142">Ducey had the container wall removed</a>.</p>

<p>The cost of erecting, then disassembling the wall: $197 million. (The state recouped about $1.4 million by selling the containers.)</p>

<p>Daniel Scarpinato, Ducey’s former chief of staff, said border security is a significant issue for nearby communities and requires resources, “especially given the failures of the federal government.” He noted that the Ducey administration didn’t ignore other needs in the area, including spending to attract doctors to rural Arizona. “But we will make no apologies for prioritizing public safety and security at our border,” he said.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            Southeast Arizona Medical Center closed in 2015, leaving the Douglas area without a full-service hospital.
    
    
    
    

    

        
    
                    
<p>Grijalva, a Douglas native, was sworn in as mayor in December with a list of needs he is determined to make progress on: a community center, more food assistance for the growing number of hungry residents and a hospital. Money the state spent on the container wall would’ve been better used on those projects, he said. “I appreciate Doug Ducey trying that, but those resources could have gone into the community,” he said.</p>

<p>The median income in Douglas is $39,000, about half the state’s median income, and almost a third of the town’s residents live in poverty. A shrinking tax base makes it difficult for Douglas to provide basic services. The town doesn’t have enough money for street repairs, let alone to reopen a hospital. The backlog of repaving projects has climbed to $67 million, while Douglas nets only $400,000 a year for street improvements.</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p>Money for wall construction or National Guard units gives a short-term boost to the economy, but those efforts can also interfere with the economic lifeblood of towns like Douglas: cross-border traffic.</p>

<p>Both Trump and Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, have deployed hundreds of guard members and active military personnel to the border. None have shown up in Douglas yet, Grijalva said. When they do, they’ll spend money. But a couple dozen troops don’t compare to the 3.6 million people who cross the border each year. The Walmart in Douglas, a stone’s throw from the port of entry, is packed daily with shoppers from Agua Prieta, Sonora, Grijalva said. More troops on both sides of the port bottleneck traffic and raise people’s fears of being detained, which may discourage them from crossing, even when they are doing so legally, he said.</p>

<p>Shortly after Trump’s inauguration, Grijalva declared a state of emergency, which could make the city eligible for federal aid if its economy takes a hit. “I know the executive orders didn’t do anything to stop the legal immigration, but it’s the perception,” Grijalva said. “If our economy dips in any way, they could give us some funding.”</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            Douglas’ new mayor, Jose Grijalva, declared a state of emergency in January over concerns that Trump’s executive orders on border security and immigration will harm the border town’s fragile economy.
    
    
    
    

    

        
    
                    
<p>Attracting a new hospital is a longer-term effort. Construction alone could cost upwards of $75 million. But then it would have to be staffed. In its final years, the hospital in Douglas suffered from the shortage of health care professionals plaguing much of rural America. The year it closed, it had no onsite physicians, said Dr. Dan Derksen, director of the Arizona Center for Rural Health. The state has programs to address that problem, including helping doctors in rural areas repay school loans. But the shortage has persisted. If a hospital were to open again in Douglas, it could cost as much as $775,000 to launch a residency program there, according to Derksen and Dr. Conrad Clemens, who heads graduate medical education for the University of Arizona.</p>

<p>“There’s policy strategies that you can do at the state level that help, but there’s no single strategy that is a cure-all,” Derksen said. “You have to do a variety of strategies.”</p>

<p>Border security funding, on the other hand, is easier to get.</p>

<p>Cochise County Sheriff Mark Dannels is known for his aggressive border enforcement activities. His office soaks up state and federal grants to help with drug interdiction, human trafficking and surveillance equipment on the border. The state also awarded him $20 million for a new jail and $5 million to open a border security operations center, a base for various agencies enforcing the border, in Sierra Vista, about an hour from Douglas.</p>

<p>At its grand opening in November, Dannels said all he had to do was ask for the money.</p>

<p>“I was speaking with Gov. Ducey and the governor asked me, ‘What do you guys need?’” Dannels said. “I said, ‘We need a collective center that drives actions.’” Shortly after, the plan came together, he said.</p>

<p>However, if Cochise Regional Hospital were still open, Dannels’ office would have one less security concern. The abandoned building, which is deteriorating in an isolated pocket of desert on the outskirts of Douglas, is a common waypoint for smugglers.</p>

Title    : An Indian Drugmaker, Investigated by ProPublica Last Year, Has Recalled Two Dozen Medications Sold to U.S. Patients

<p>Glenmark Pharmaceuticals has recalled two dozen generic medicines sold to American patients because the Indian factory that made them failed to comply with U.S. manufacturing standards and the Food and Drug Administration determined that the faulty drugs could harm people, federal records show.</p>

<p>In February, the FDA found problems with cleaning and testing at the plant in Madhya Pradesh, India, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/glenmark-pharmaceuticals-recalls-fda-oversight">which was the subject of a ProPublica investigation last year</a>. The current recalls, listed in an FDA enforcement report last week, cover a wide range of commonly prescribed medicines, including ones that treat epilepsy, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, heart disease and high blood pressure, among other ailments. ​​A full list of the <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/ires/index.cfm?Event=96474">recalled medications is available here</a>.  </p>

<p>The agency determined that the drugs could cause temporary or reversible harm and that the chance of more serious problems was remote. However, the FDA didn’t say what symptoms the flawed drugs could cause. ProPublica asked the FDA and Glenmark for more specifics, but neither responded.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>Records show that Glenmark <a href="https://www.ipdpharma.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Glenmark-Recall-3.18.2025.pdf">first alerted wholesalers about the recalls</a> in a March 13 letter. That letter suggests that Glenmark pulled the drugs because of potential cross-contamination. Thomas Callaghan, Glenmark’s executive director of regulatory affairs for North America, wrote that 148 batches of the recalled medicines were made “in a shared facility” with two cholesterol-lowering drugs, ezetimibe and a combination of that drug and simvastatin. </p>

<p>That’s a concern because the chemical structure of ezetimibe contains what’s known as a beta-lactam ring. FDA safety experts pay attention to this because many beta-lactam drugs, particularly penicillin, can cause life-threatening allergies and hypersensitivity reactions. It’s the <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2818947">most commonly reported drug allergy</a> in the U.S. Because of that danger, the FDA requires manufacturers to follow <a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/159358/download">special precautions to prevent cross-contamination</a> with drugs that contain a beta-lactam ring, even if they aren’t antibiotics. </p>

<p>The chemical structure of ezetimibe, Callaghan wrote to Glenmark’s wholesalers, shows it is unlikely to cause such hypersensitivity reactions. Nevertheless, Glenmark was recalling the drugs “based on risk assessment and out of an abundance of caution,” Callaghan wrote. He added, “This recall is being made with knowledge of the Food and Drug Administration.”</p>

<p>According to Callaghan’s letter, the potential problem dates back years. The executive wrote that Glenmark began shipping the drugs on Oct. 4, 2022.</p>

<p>In December, ProPublica revealed that the Glenmark factory was responsible for an outsized share of U.S. recalls for pills that didn’t dissolve properly and could harm people. At the time, the FDA hadn’t inspected the plant since before the COVID-19 pandemic, even though one of those recalls had been linked to deaths of American patients. </p>

<p>About two months after that investigation was published, <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/glenmark-pharmaceuticals-recalls-fda-inspection">FDA officials returned to the factory</a> — the agency’s first inspection in five years. Inspectors discovered that Glenmark hadn’t properly cleaned equipment to prevent contamination of medicines with residues from other drugs. The federal investigators also noted that Glenmark routinely released some drugs to the U.S. market using test methods that hadn’t been adequately validated, according to the inspection report. </p>

<p>What’s more, when some Glenmark tests found problems with a drug, the company at times declared those results invalid and “retested with new samples to obtain passing results,” the inspection report said. “The batches were ultimately released to the US market.”</p>

<p>In <a href="https://legacy.www.documentcloud.org/documents/25591264-fda-483-inspection-report-of-glenmarks-madhya-pradesh-factory/">their detailed report</a>, the inspectors listed drugs shipped to U.S. customers who had been affected by the potential contamination and testing problems, but FDA censors redacted page after page, making it impossible to know which medicines may not be safe. An FDA attorney said the information was being withheld because it contained trade secrets or commercial information that was considered privileged or confidential.</p>

<p>ProPublica first asked Glenmark about that inspection on March 7 after obtaining the FDA report through the Freedom of Information Act. Glenmark alerted wholesalers about the recalls less than a week later, but the company and the FDA didn’t tell ProPublica. </p>

<p>Instead, a Glenmark spokesperson sent a statement saying the company was “committed to working diligently with the FDA to ensure compliance with manufacturing operations and quality systems.” And the FDA said it could discuss potential compliance matters only with the company involved. </p>

<p>The FDA first mentioned the recalls publicly in its April 8 <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/ires/index.cfm?Event=96474">enforcement report</a>, which is like an electronic filing cabinet for recalls. The recalls do not appear on the FDA’s <a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts">recalls website</a>, which compiles press releases written by pharmaceutical companies. </p>

<p>ProPublica asked the FDA and Glenmark why they didn’t alert the public last month that these medicines had been recalled, but neither responded. </p>

<p>Glenmark is embroiled in a federal lawsuit that alleges recalled potassium chloride capsules made at its Madhya Pradesh factory caused the death of a 91-year-old Maine woman in June. The FDA had determined last year that more than 50 million of those recalled Glenmark extended-release capsules <a href="https://www.fda.gov/safety/recalls-market-withdrawals-safety-alerts/glenmark-pharmaceuticals-inc-usa-issues-voluntary-nationwide-recall-potassium-chloride-extended">had the potential to kill</a> U.S. patients because they didn’t dissolve correctly and could lead to a perilous spike in potassium. In court filings, Glenmark has denied responsibility for the woman’s death.</p>

<p>Since that potassium chloride recall, Glenmark has told federal regulators it has received reports of eight deaths in the U.S. of people who took the recalled capsules, FDA records show. Companies are required to file such reports so the agency can monitor drug safety. The FDA shares few details, though, so ProPublica was unable to independently verify what happened in each case. In general, the FDA says these adverse event reports reflect the opinions of the people who reported the harm and don’t prove that the drug caused it.</p>

Title    : Two Months After Trump’s Funding Cuts, a Nonprofit Struggles to Support Refugees and Itself

<p>When Max Rykov started reading a Jan. 24 letter sent to the leaders of the country’s 10 refugee resettlement agencies, he found the wording vague but ominous. The <a href="https://legacy.www.documentcloud.org/documents/25893969-suspension-letter-for-foreign-assistance-gr/">agencies were ordered</a> to “stop all work” funded by the Department of State and “not incur any new costs.”</p>

<p>At first, he wondered if the order from the Trump administration was only targeting refugee work in other countries. Rykov, then the director of development and communications at a refugee resettlement partner in Nashville, began texting colleagues at other agencies. “What does it mean?” he asked. </p>

<p>By Monday, three days after the memo, it became clear. The Nashville International Center for Empowerment, along with similar nonprofits across the country, would not have access to the money the government had promised to refugees for their first three months in the United States. That day, NICE laid off 12 of its 56 resettlement staff members and scrambled to free up funds to pay for the basic needs of nearly 170 people dependent on the frozen grants.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            Max Rykov arrived in the U.S. as a child and went on to become the director of development and communications at the Nashville International Center for Empowerment, which helps refugees resettle.

<p>Rykov knew exactly what was at stake, and that delivered an additional dose of dread. Born in the former USSR, he and his family arrived in the U.S. as refugees in 1993, fleeing the collapse of the Soviet Union, the economic devastation and discrimination against Soviet Jews. He was 4 years old, and it was bewildering. Though his family was part of one of the largest waves of refugee resettlement in U.S. history, they ended up in a place with few Russian immigrants.</p>

<p>Life in Birmingham, Alabama, a post-industrial city shaped by the Civil Rights movement and white flight, revolved around Saturday college football games and Sunday church. Rykov said his family felt “barren” in the U.S. away from their culture. Birmingham’s Jewish community was small and the Russian population tiny.</p>

<p>But a local Jewish organization sponsored the Rykovs and paired them with a “friendship family.” The group rented them an apartment and furnished it. Then the organization helped Rykov’s parents find work. And Birmingham’s Jewish community banded together to fund scholarships for Rykov and other Soviet refugee children to attend a private Jewish school, where Rykov felt less isolated.</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p>He went on to attend the University of Alabama and overcame his feeling of otherness. After graduation, he found purpose in bringing people together through his work organizing cultural events, including arts festivals and an adult spelling bee, doing social media outreach for the Birmingham mayor and, in 2021, finding a dream job at a Nashville nonprofit devoted to the very efforts that he believes helped define him. </p>

<p>When Rykov heard that President Donald Trump’s second administration had ordered cuts to the refugee program, his thoughts raced to the Venezuelan refugee family his organization was assisting, an older woman in poor health, her daughter who cared for her and the daughter’s two children, one not yet kindergarten age. None of them spoke English, and there was no plan for how they would cover the rent, which was due in four days. </p>

<p>“This is a promise that we made to these people that we have reneged on,” he said. “Is that really what’s happening? Yeah, that’s exactly what’s happening.”</p>

<p>As the realization of what lay ahead set in, Rykov started to cry.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>Over the next two months, the Trump administration <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.344495/gov.uscourts.wawd.344495.31.0.pdf">carried out and defended</a> its destabilizing cuts to the refugee program. The moves brought wave after wave of uncertainty and chaos to the lives of refugees and those who work to help resettle them. </p>

<p>One of the largest nonprofit agencies that carry out this work, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, laid off a third of its staff in February and said Monday that <a href="https://apnews.com/article/catholic-bishops-refugee-resettlement-trump-administration-362231100b8e4650c00d22a75b5c6ab8">it would end all of its refugee efforts</a> with the federal government. A Jewish resettlement organization, <a href="https://www.jns.org/hias-fires-furloughs-40-of-staff-due-to-trump-cuts-to-refugee-work/">HIAS, cut 40% of its staf</a>f. As the groups fight legal battles to recoup the millions of dollars the government owes them, some have been forced to close resettlement offices entirely.</p>

<p>The Nashville International Center for Empowerment is still struggling to keep its own afloat. Although NICE staff members had anticipated some cuts to refugee programs under Trump, they said they were caught off guard when reimbursements for money already spent failed to appear and by the dwindling opportunities to seek recourse.</p>

<p>After a judge ordered the Trump administration to restart refugee admissions, the administration responded by canceling contracts with existing resettlement agencies and announcing plans to find new partners. And the administration has indicated it will remain resistant, refusing to spend millions appropriated by Congress for refugees.</p>

<p>“Many have lost faith and trust in the American system because of this,” said Wooksoo Kim, director of the Immigrant and Refugee Research Institute at the University of Buffalo. “For many refugees, it may start to feel like it’s no different from where they came from.” </p>

<p>In court documents, lawyers for the Department of Justice argued the U.S. does not have the capacity to support large numbers of refugees.</p>

<p>“The President lawfully exercised his authority to suspend the admission of refugees pending a determination that ‘further entry into the United States of refugees aligns with the interests of the United States,’” the motion said. </p>

<p>In Nashville, that anxiety has been playing out week after week in tear-filled offices and in apartment complexes teeming with families who fled war and oppression.</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p>Rykov couldn’t help but feel overwhelmed by the extreme shift in attitudes about immigrants in just a few years. In 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine, his family’s dormant fears about Russia were reawakened — but they felt a surge of pride for the U.S. when it stepped up to help Ukraine and welcome its refugees. </p>

<p>Months after the invasion, Ukrainian athletes came to Birmingham for the World Games, which is similar to the Olympics. When they entered the stadium waving the Ukrainian flag, the crowd gave them a <a href="https://www.cbs42.com/news/ukrainian-athlete-reacts-to-the-world-games-opening-ceremony/">standing ovation</a>. His parents, who’d never felt quite at home in the U.S., loudly joined in the “U-S-A” chant that followed.</p>

<p>But now, three years later, was all of America now ready to abandon refugees? Rykov was starting to see the signs, but he refused to believe it and instead recommitted himself to the work.</p>

<p>He and his colleagues reached out to every donor in their network and called an online meeting with local churches who might be able to help with rent payments, food, job searches and transportation. </p>

<p>Agencies would struggle without the help of the churches. And churches don’t have the resources, training or bandwidth to carry out the work of the agencies. </p>

<p>But Rykov knew that for the time being, he’d need more help than ever from church volunteers.</p>

<p>“Without your intervention here, this is gonna be a humanitarian disaster in Nashville,” he told them in the online meeting held about a week after the cuts. “And in every community, obviously, but we were focusing on ours. We’re not gonna be in a position to help in the same way much longer, and this is a stark reality that we’re facing.”</p>

<p>Then he went <a href="https://www.newschannel5.com/news/we-cant-let-them-down-federal-funding-freeze-puts-refugees-at-risk-in-nashville?fbclid=IwY2xjawJhGEhleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABHmKOpjhdkkHqFPkvTvgd5MUpY1YPWxPWWNaThe6Sa_ECdJz7HrwVIYKQ9Guc_aem_WssM1rMgk-3IAIXrFi6xsg">on the local news</a>, warning that “this immediate funding freeze puts those recently arrived refugees really at risk of homelessness.” The responses on social media reflected the hate and intolerance that had polluted the national conversation about immigration.</p>

<p>“The common theme was, ‘Refugees? Do you mean “illegal invaders”?’” Rykov recalled. “People are so completely misinformed, clearly not reading the article or watching the story, and it’s very disappointing to see that. And I guess it’s sad too that I expect it.”</p>
        
    
                            
    
                                One Month After the Cuts
    
    
        “No Time to Screw Around”
    
        
    
                    
<p>In late February, church volunteer Abdul Makembe and a program manager from NICE squeezed into the cramped apartment of a family of five from the Democratic Republic of Congo. </p>

<p>Both Makembe and NICE had been working with the family for months, but with the loss of funding, NICE could no longer offer support and had asked Makembe to be more involved.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            Abdul Makembe, who immigrated from Tanzania, volunteers to help African families settle in the U.S.
    
            (Arielle Weenonia Gray for ProPublica)
    
    
    

    

        
    
                    
<p>A native of Tanzania, Makembe moved to Tennessee in the late 1970s. After working in infectious disease research and nonprofit management, which involved several trips to Africa, he retired in 2015 and began volunteering to help newly arrived African families. Rykov came to know him as a fixture of the refugee community, always eager to help.</p>

<p>In the apartment, Makembe perched on the edge of a couch and Mungaga Akilimali sat across from him on the floor. </p>

<p>“So, the situation has improved a little bit?” Makembe asked.</p>

<p>The Congolese man ran his hands over his head.</p>

<p>“The situation, so far, not yet,” Akilimali said. “I’m just trying to apply and reapply and reapply, but so far nothing.”</p>

<p>Akilimali and his family fled the Democratic Republic of Congo more than 10 years ago. Since 1996, soldiers and militias have killed 6 million people there and committed atrocities against countless civilians. War, political instability and widespread poverty have displaced millions of others. </p>

<p>Akilimali and his wife settled for a time in South Africa, where they encountered xenophobia and anti-immigrant violence. Immigrants and refugees have become political scapegoats there, spawning a rash of attacks and even murders. His wife, Bulonza Chishamara, nearly died there in 2018 after an ambush by an anti-immigrant mob.</p>

<p>Doctors gave her eight units of blood and Chishamara spent days paralyzed in a hospital bed, Akilimali said. She still walks with a limp.</p>

<p>The family had rejoiced when they got approved for refugee resettlement in 2024 in Tennessee. Their new life in Nashville began with promise. Akilimali, who speaks fluent English and trained as a mechanic, got a driver’s license and a job at Nissan.</p>

<p>However, he lost the job before his probationary period ended due to layoffs, and he hasn’t been able to find another one. NICE used to have a robust staff of employment specialists. But the cuts forced the organization to reassign them.</p>

<p>That left fewer resources for people like Akilimali, who had been in the U.S. longer than the three months during which new refugees were eligible for state department aid but who still needed help finding work.</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p>For Rykov, the work of spreading awareness about the cuts and raising funds to offset them intensified throughout February. He and others working with refugees across the country were hoping that the courts might force the administration to release the federal money — that if they could keep things afloat in the short term, relief would come. </p>

<p>Then, on Feb. 25, a federal judge in Washington ruled in favor of the agencies. He ordered the administration to restore payments and restart refugee admissions.</p>

<p>The relief was short-lived. A day later, the administration canceled contracts with resettlement agencies, and lawyers for the administration have appealed the order. Their argument: The gutted refugee agencies no longer have capacity to restart resettlement, making it impossible to comply with court orders. </p>

<p>Rykov said some of the diminished number of remaining staff members began to look for new jobs.</p>

<p>After that, Rykov and his team kicked into emergency mode. They worked long hours making phone calls and arranging meetings with potential volunteers and donors.</p>

<p>“It was a cocktail of emotions,” he said. The generosity of donors and volunteers filled him with gratitude. But he couldn’t escape the sense of foreboding that consumed the office, where many desks sat empty and remaining employees voiced deepening concerns about the fates of their clients.</p>

<p>Rykov likened the urgent energy at NICE to the aftermath of a natural disaster. “There’s no time to screw around.”</p>

<p>At the same time, staffers worried about the cratering budget and the future of the organization. And it was hard not to notice how much the mood in Tennessee and around the country was shifting. In an <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/realigning-the-united-states-refugee-admissions-program/">order suspending refugee admissions</a>, Trump described immigrants as a “burden” who have “inundated” American towns and cities.NICE had always felt protected, powered by an idealistic and diverse staff who chose to work in refugee resettlement despite the long hours and low pay. The cuts and the discourse eroded that sense of safety, Rykov said.</p>

<p>In February, a tech company offered him a job in Birmingham. It was a chance to be closer to his parents and back in the city where he’d come of age — a reminder of an era that felt kinder than the current one. He took the job.</p>

<p>“Working at NICE, it’s the best job I ever had and the most meaningful job I ever had,” he said.</p>

<p>Rykov packed up a few things from NICE. A Ukrainian flag lapel pin. A signed photograph of him and his coworkers. In his Birmingham apartment, he placed the picture on a bookshelf next to one of him and his parents at his high school graduation.</p>

<p>By the time he left, NICE’s refugee resettlement team was down to 30 employees; it had been 56 before the cuts. For its part, NICE has vowed to carry on. The organization has paired 24 families with volunteer mentors since the funding cuts.</p>

<p>Church volunteers, who were accustomed to helping furnish and decorate apartments for new arrivals, now had to help prevent evictions. They had to track down documents and help complete paperwork lost in the confusion of the nonprofit’s layoffs. And the group of mostly retired professionals now had to assist with the daunting task of finding unskilled jobs for refugees who didn’t speak much English.</p>
        
    
                            
    
                                Two Months After the Cuts
    
    
        One Volunteer, Many People in Need
    
        
    
                    
<p>On a mid-March morning, Makembe woke at 6 a.m. to begin tackling his volunteer work for NICE. Despite the long hours he clocks volunteering, the 74-year-old has kept his energy level and his spirits up. As he left the garage apartment he shares with his wife in a rough north Nashville neighborhood, he made sure to double-check the locks. </p>

<p>On this day, he was working not with the Akilimali family but with a family of four who recently arrived from Africa. The child needs to see a specialist at the Children’s Hospital at Vanderbilt.</p>

<p>It was Vanderbilt that brought Makembe to Nashville decades ago, for his master’s degree in economic planning. He followed that with a doctorate in health policy and research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Over the years that followed, he made repeated trips back to Tanzania to do research on malaria and parasitic infections.</p>

<p>All that took a toll on Makembe’s marriage, and he and his first wife divorced when his two children were very young. They are now grown and successful. His son is an accountant and his daughter recently finished law school and works at a firm in New York. That leaves him more time to spend with refugees.</p>

<p>But the volunteer work does bring some financial stress. He is trying to save $5,000 to apply for a green card for his wife, which is tough. Because he spent much of his career working outside the U.S., Makembe receives less than $1,000 a month from Social Security. He drives a 2004 Toyota that was donated to his church to aid the congregation’s work with refugees, but he pays out of pocket for gas and car insurance. The costs can add up. It’s not uncommon for him to burn a quarter tank of gas a day when he is volunteering.</p>

<p>Makembe’s church, Woodmont Hills Church, is a significant contributor to the city’s refugee resettlement work — an ethos shared by its current congregants but that has led to the loss of members over the years. Though it had a congregation nearing 3,000 members in the late ’90s, attendance shrank as the church’s ideology grew more progressive and Tennessee’s grew more conservative. It’s now down to 800 members. </p>

<p>Yet the church remained steadfast in its commitment to helping refugees. Its leaders invited NICE to hold classes in its empty meeting rooms and made space to house a Swahili church and a Baptist church formed by refugees from Myanmar. And when NICE lost funding, Woodmont Hills members donated their time and money.</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p>Makembe has helped dozens of refugees over the years but was particularly worried for the family he had to take to the Children’s Hospital that March morning, serving as both driver and translator. They arrived right before Trump cut off funding, and they had struggled to get medical care for their 5-year-old’s persistent seizures. A doctor at a local clinic had prescribed antiseizure medication, but it didn’t work, and the child experienced episodes where his muscles tensed and froze for minutes at a time.</p>

<p>Nashville has world-class medical facilities, but NICE no longer had staff available to help the family understand and navigate that care, leaving them frustrated. </p>

<p>It took months for the family to get in to see a specialist. During the long wait, Makembe said, the boy’s father began to lose hope. His son’s seizures had become longer and more frequent. Makembe stepped in to help them get a referral from a doctor at the local clinic.</p>

<p>The child’s father had to miss the doctor’s appointment that March morning so that he could go to an interview at a company that packages computer parts. Both he and his wife had been searching for jobs and striking out. Makembe has tried to help but has run into barriers. He does not have the same connections with labor agencies that NICE staffers did. </p>

<p>Makembe said he wants to get the child enrolled in a special school for the fall and find a wheelchair so his mom won’t have to carry him.</p>

<p>And that’s just this family. Makembe said new refugees have been waiting for months to get job interviews. When he visits the five families he mentors, their neighbors approach him asking for help. Many of their requests are for the assistance NICE and other refugee agencies once offered.</p>

<p>“I’m very much worried,” he said. “I mean, they have no idea of what to do.”</p>

Title    : Congress Has Demanded Answers to ICE Detaining Americans. The Administration Has Responded With Silence.

<p>Just a week into President Donald Trump’s second term, Rep. Adriano Espaillat began to see reports of Puerto Ricans and others being questioned and arrested by immigration agents.  </p>

<p>So Espaillat, a New York Democrat, did what members of Congress often do: He <a href="https://espaillat.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/espaillat.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/01.27.25-letter-ice-raids-in-pr-nj.pdf">wrote</a> to the administration and demanded answers. That was more than 10 weeks ago. Espaillat has not received a response. </p>

<p>His experience appears to be common. </p>

<p>At least a dozen members of Congress, all Democrats, have written to the Trump administration with pointed questions about constituents and other citizens whom immigration agents have questioned, detained and even <a href="https://www.warner.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2025/3/warner-pushes-trump-administration-on-alarming-immigration-arrest-of-u-s-citizen-and-virginia-resident">held at gunpoint</a>. In one letter, Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee <a href="https://democrats-judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/2025-02-04_raskin_jayapal_to_noem_dhs_vitello_ice.pdf">demanded a list</a> of every citizen detained during the new administration.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>None has received an answer.</p>

<p>“What we are clearly seeing is that with this administration, they are not responding to congressional inquiries,” said Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, a New Mexico Democrat. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/letter_demanding_a_stop_to_unconscionable_ice_harassment_of_native_american_citizens.pdf">Leger Fernández and others wrote</a> to Trump and the Department of Homeland Security on Jan. 28 after receiving complaints from constituents and tribal nations that federal agents were pressing tribal citizens in New Mexico for their immigration status, raising concerns about racial profiling.</p>

<p>The congresswoman and others say the lack of response is part of a broader pattern in which the administration has been moving to sideline Congress and its constitutional power to <a href="https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/essay/artI-S8-C18-7-1/ALDE_00013657/">investigate the executive branch</a>.</p>

<p>“That is a big concern on a level beyond what ICE is doing,” Leger Fernández said, referring to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a branch of DHS. “This administration does not seem to recognize the power and authority and responsibility” of Congress.</p>

<p>Norman Ornstein, a longtime congressional observer at the American Enterprise Institute, said prior administrations’ lack of responsiveness has frustrated lawmakers too. But he’s never seen one so thoroughly brush off Congress.  </p>

<p>“What’s clear now is that the message from Donald Trump and his minions is: ‘You don’t have to respond to these people, whether they are ours or not,’” Ornstein said, referring to Republicans and Democrats. “That’s not usual. Nothing about this is usual.”</p>

<p>A White House spokesperson denied that the administration has been circumventing Congress or its oversight. “Passage of the continuing resolution that kept our government open and commonsense legislation like the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/laken-riley-act-explained.html">Laken Riley Act</a> are indicative of how closely the Trump administration is working with Congress,” said Kush Desai in a statement. </p>

<p>The White House did not answer questions about the letters. DHS also did not respond to ProPublica’s questions.</p>

<p>Last month, ProPublica detailed how <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/more-americans-will-be-caught-up-trump-immigration-raids">Americans have been caught</a> in the administration’s dragnet. Such mistakes have been made by many administrations over decades. The government often has not taken steps to reduce errors, such as updating its files when agents confirm somebody’s citizenship. But experts and advocates have warned that Trump’s aggressive immigration goals — including <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2025/01/26/ice-arrests-raids-trump-quota/">arrest quotas</a> for enforcement agents — make it more likely that citizens will get caught up.</p>

<p>ICE and its sister agency, Customs and Border Protection, said in earlier statements to ProPublica that agents are allowed to ask for citizens’ identification. The agencies did not provide explanations for their actions in most of the cases ProPublica asked about. </p>

<p>Answers were also hard to come by during Trump’s first term, even when Democrats controlled the House and had more power over hearings. </p>

<p>At a House hearing in 2019 about <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/children-separated-from-parents-border-patrol-cbp-trump-immigration-policy">family separation</a>, lawmakers pressed then-Border Patrol Chief Brian Hastings about another issue: the three-week detention of a Dallas-born high school student and citizen, who was only released after The Dallas Morning News <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/immigration/2019/07/26/a-dallas-born-citizen-picked-up-by-the-border-patrol-has-been-detained-for-three-weeks-his-lawyer-says/">reported what happened</a>. </p>

<p>Hastings said the student never claimed to be a citizen during his detention — though <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/immigration/2019/07/25/a-border-patrol-chief-testifies-that-francisco-galicia-never-claimed-u-s-citizenship-but-document-says-otherwise/">the newspaper reported</a> that the agency’s own paperwork noted the opposite. Hastings also declined to give any broader accounting of how often the agency had held Americans. “I don’t have information about specific cases,” he said. (Hastings did not respond to requests for comment.)</p>

<p>Espaillat, the New York representative, has been in office for eight years. He said he frequently raised immigration questions and concerns during the Biden administration too, and got responses.</p>

<p>Republicans complained about the opposite experience during the Biden administration. <a href="https://homeland.house.gov/2024/11/01/chairman-green-subpoenas-dhs-secretary-mayorkas-over-failure-to-produce-documents-on-inoperable-surveillance-cameras-along-the-southwest-border/#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2C%20D.C.%20%E2%80%94%20Yesterday%2C%20House,deployed%20along%20the%20Southwest%20border">They said</a> the administration was unresponsive to Congress’ questions on immigration, forcing lawmakers to <a href="https://homeland.house.gov/2024/04/30/new-documents-reveal-airports-used-by-secretary-mayorkas-to-fly-hundreds-of-thousands-of-inadmissible-aliens-into-u-s-via-chnv-mass-parole-scheme/">subpoena officials</a> for answers. (The administration <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/4601171-house-republicans-subpoena-mayorkas-over-migrant-numbers/">dismissed</a> the moves as “political posturing.”) </p>

<p>Espaillat said he’s not surprised the Trump administration has been silent. “They probably don’t have a good answer.”</p>

Title    : Trump’s DOJ Has Frozen Police Reform Work. Advocates Fear More Abuse in Departments Across the Country.

<p>When news broke in January that the Trump Justice Department was <a href="https://apnews.com/article/civil-rights-division-justice-department-trump-2dcb45cca7c9c9cdaea78282d4279c35">freezing significant work on civil rights litigation, including police reform cases</a>, attention immediately focused on two cities: Minneapolis and Louisville, Kentucky.</p>

<p>Both places were on the cusp of entering court-enforced agreements to overhaul their police forces after high-profile police killings there sparked a nationwide reckoning over race and policing.</p>

<p>But it’s now clear that the administration’s move will be felt well beyond those two cities. In fact, it throws into question police reform efforts in at least eight other communities across the country, according to a ProPublica review. The need for change in these places was documented in a flurry of investigations published by the Justice Department in the final year of Joe Biden’s presidency. All of the probes found a “pattern or practice” of unlawful behavior that was routine enough that the federal government recommended reforms.</p>

<p>From Phoenix to Trenton, New Jersey, federal officials investigating the eight agencies found unjustified killings, excessive force, debtors’ prisons, retaliation against police critics, racial discrimination, unlawful strip searches and officers having sexual contact with sex workers during undercover operations.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>Such findings are typically the first step toward a department agreeing to federal oversight and court-ordered reform. Over the years, the DOJ has credited such agreements, known as consent decrees, for having helped departments reduce unnecessary use of force, cut crime rates and improve responses to people with behavioral health needs. President Donald Trump’s Justice Department, however, has <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/22/politics/justice-department-trump-police-reform-agreements/index.html">ordered its civil rights attorneys</a> to pause such work until further notice, effectively reinstating the limited approach it took during the president’s first term. Department officials did not respond to questions about the pause or how long it would remain in effect.</p>

<p>For now, that means any reform efforts will be up to local leadership — a dynamic that experts say could bode poorly for communities with long histories of police abuse.</p>

<p>Cliff Johnson, an attorney and director of the Mississippi office of the MacArthur Justice Center, a nonprofit legal organization, was not optimistic.</p>

<p>“While those DOJ reports sometimes can lead municipalities, police departments and other offenders to come to Jesus,” Johnson said, “what we’ve been seeing, from our perspective, is folks saying, ‘I don’t need Jesus. I got Trump.’”</p>

<p>Louisiana leaders, for example, have slammed the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25599567-findings-report-louisiana-state-police/">Justice Department’s report</a>, which found a pattern of problems in the way the state police used force against civilians. Gov. Jeff Landry said the report was an attempt by the Biden administration to “diminish the service and exceptionality” of the state police. And state Attorney General Liz Murrill said the Justice Department was being used to “advance a political agenda.”</p>

<p>The report was partly spurred by the 2019 death of Ronald Greene, who was killed while in the custody of Louisiana State Police. Officers repeatedly shocked him with a Taser, dragged him by his ankle shackles and then left him face down in the road. Some officers deactivated or muted their body cameras during the incident. Louisiana troopers had claimed Greene died when his car crashed after a high-speed chase. The department was forced to change its story when The <a href="https://apnews.com/article/police-brutality-louisiana-ronald-greene-race-civil-rights-4446d9b069803545247c610882951763">Associated Press obtained and published</a> body-camera footage of the incident.</p>

<p>Federal investigators found the episode was not an outlier. According to their report, officers in the department used Tasers without warning and against people who were restrained or who did not pose a threat, didn’t give people the chance to comply before using force, used force against people who weren’t a threat, and used excessive force against people running from officers.</p>

<p>A spokesperson for the Louisiana State Police did not answer questions about the report’s findings but said the agency is working to improve its relationship with citizens and other stakeholders. Landry’s office did not respond to ProPublica’s questions about the report and the state’s response, and Murrill’s office declined to comment.</p>

<p>Across the state line in <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25599570-findings-report-lexington-police-department/">Lexington, Mississippi</a>, the Justice Department’s shift away from police accountability could also be consequential. Department officials said residents there were so afraid of local police that they were hesitant to meet with investigators in public, fearful of retaliation.</p>

<p>They had good reason to be concerned. In 2023, officers arrested an attorney who was representing citizens in police abuse cases against the department. She had been filming a traffic stop at the time.</p>

<p>The police force — made up of about 10 officers, some of whom are part time — is the smallest the Justice Department has investigated in decades. Federal investigators ultimately found that its officers use excessive force, discriminate against Black people, conduct stops and searches without probable cause, and arrest people purely for not having the money to pay fines.</p>

<p>It’s unclear what steps, if any, the Lexington Police Department is taking in response to the report. Police Chief Charles Henderson declined to comment and directed questions to the city attorney, who did not return a call.</p>

<p>Reform advocates have put their hopes in upcoming elections in Lexington that could bring in new leadership that is more interested in making changes at the police department.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25599569-findings-report-investigation-of-the-mount-vernon-police-department/">Mount Vernon, New York</a>, advocates say they’ve seen little movement since the Justice Department found police there use excessive force, conduct unlawful strip and body cavity searches of arrestees, and fail to properly train officers and supervisors. It also found police discriminated against Black people. One group is considering legal action to bring the city to the table.</p>

<p>“It seems like Mount Vernon has put lip service on addressing the findings,” said Daniel Lambright, an attorney with the New York Civil Liberties Union. “It remains unclear actually what they’re doing to address the findings.”</p>

<p>In their report, federal investigators expressed concern that the police department’s “overly aggressive tactics unnecessarily escalate encounters.” In one instance, they wrote, five Mount Vernon officers used force on a man they thought was selling drugs — without announcing their presence or attempting to arrest him peacefully. Instead, one of the officers approached the man from behind and attempted to put him in an “upper body hold,” which started an altercation, according to the report. Police then threw the man to the ground. One officer drove his Taser into the suspect five times while another repeatedly punched him in the head. The man suffered a broken nose.</p>

<p>“The reform efforts have to continue,” said the Rev. Stephen Pogue, a member of the United Black Clergy of Westchester, an organization that works on social justice matters in Mount Vernon and surrounding areas. “We’re not in one of those places where Trump is our god. In Mount Vernon, we still need Jesus.”</p>

<p>Pogue said he hopes the city will host a public meeting about the report before the summer.</p>

<p>Mayor Shawyn Patterson-Howard and a police spokesperson did not reply to interview requests. But in December, the mayor said in a statement that the city would work with the Justice Department to address its findings. “We wholeheartedly support our good officers and at the same time will not tolerate and will punish unconstitutional policing,” she said.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25599574-phoenix-findings-report-final-final-508/">Phoenix</a>, city and police officials have sent conflicting signals about the federal investigation, which found the Police Department used excessive and deadly force, violated the rights of homeless people, and discriminated against Black, Latino, Native American people, as well as those who have behavioral disabilities. “Why the hell would anybody ever accept a consent decree?” said one City Council member months before the report was released. Afterward, the head of the police union said the investigation was a “farce” and part of an “unprofessional smear campaign.”</p>

<p>But Mayor Kate Gallego has said the city is taking the report seriously. In September, the City Council passed several police reform measures, including requiring all officers who deal with the public to use body-worn cameras, even the special units that have been at the center of controversial shootings.</p>

<p>“Regardless of the new federal administration, these reforms are moving forward, and the mayor’s commitment to improving the police department is unwavering,” a mayoral spokesperson told ProPublica.</p>

<p>Some of the other cities the Justice Department had targeted are taking small steps toward fixing problems the federal investigators identified, though it’s unclear whether the efforts will result in lasting change.</p>

<p>In Oklahoma City, where <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25599575-findings-report-investigation-of-oklahoma-oklahoma-city-and-oklahoma-city-police-department/">Justice found in January</a> that police officers discriminate against people with behavioral health disabilities, the city recently began funding mobile mental health units that can respond to incidents instead of police, said Jessica Hawkins, chair of the city’s Crisis Intervention Advisory Group. She said the city is also working on a written response to the DOJ report but didn’t know when it would be completed.</p>

<p>Police Chief Ron Bacy declined ProPublica’s request for an interview and through a spokesperson said the department was “still reviewing the report.”</p>

<p>In Memphis, Tennessee, where <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25599572-findings-report-memphis-police-department-and-the-city-of-memphis-0-0/">federal investigators found</a> that police use excessive force, conduct unlawful stops and discriminate against Black people, the mayor put together a reform task force, led by a retired federal judge. “The DOJ report, in our case, kick-started a conversation that had sort of gone cold,” said Josh Spickler, executive director of Just City, an organization that works on litigation and justice matters in Memphis.</p>

<p>And in <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25599571-findings-report-investigation-of-the-city-of-trenton-and-trenton-police-department/">Trenton, New Jersey</a>, where the Justice Department found that local police have a pattern or practice of using excessive force and conducting unlawful pedestrian and vehicle stops, City Council member Jasi Edwards has been hosting community meetings to introduce the idea of a civilian complaint review board and build support for the measure. Edwards said she plans to formally put forth her proposal sometime in the fall.</p>

<p>It will likely run into resistance, though. Representatives of the Police Department and mayor told ProPublica that they didn’t believe a civilian review board was necessary because it would be costly and there are existing ways for citizens to complain about police conduct. The DOJ report, they said, highlighted some areas in need of improvement but mischaracterized a number of cases and gave an inaccurate depiction of the department’s culture.</p>

<p>In Worcester, Massachusetts, reforms are already moving forward in response to the <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25599568-finding-report-worcester-pd/">Justice Department’s investigation</a>.</p>

<p>Last month, the police chief released a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25893819-worcester-police-doj-response/">15-page report</a> on proposed measures intended to remedy the problems identified by federal investigators. The changes, which are still awaiting legal review, include prohibiting police from releasing K-9 dogs into mass gatherings or riot scenes and requiring a supervisor to go to a scene if someone reports being injured by police.</p>

<p>The police chief, Paul Socier, has also proposed several changes to how officers approach prostitution. Investigators found the department engaged in “outrageous government conduct” with sex workers by having sexual contact during undercover operations.</p>

<p>“We are hopefully headed in the right direction,” said Audra Doody, co-executive director of Safe Exit Initiative, an organization in Worcester that provides services, housing and counseling to sex workers who want to leave the sex trade. “With a time of such uncertainty, I want to believe our people in the community are telling the truth and actually are going to do what they say they’re going to do, which they seem like they are, right now.”</p>

Title    : American Rendition: Rümeysa Öztürk’s Journey From Ph.D. Scholar to Trump Target Languishing in Louisiana Cell

<p>With a line of cars waiting behind them at the train station, the two women hugged tightly as they said goodbye at the end of a spring break that hadn’t turned out to be the relaxing vacation they’d imagined.</p>

<p>Their girls trip had transformed into endless conversations about security precautions as one of the friends, 30-year-old Turkish national Rümeysa Öztürk, grew increasingly worried she would become a target of the Trump administration’s deportation campaign.</p>

<p>Öztürk, a former Fulbright scholar in a doctoral program at Tufts University, was stunned to find out in early March that she had been targeted by a pro-Israel group that highlighted an op-ed she co-wrote last year criticizing the school’s response to the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Her concern deepened days later with the detention of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/nyregion/khalil-jena-deportation-ruling.html">former Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil</a>, a permanent resident the government is trying to deport over his role in pro-Palestinian demonstrations on campus.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>By the time of Öztürk’s spring break trip on March 15, she was consumed with anxiety, said her friend E., an Arab American academic on the East Coast who asked to withhold her name and other identifying details for security reasons.</p>

<p>During their reunion in E.’s hometown, the first time they’d been together since the summer, the friends looked up know-your-rights tutorials and discussed whether Öztürk should cut short her doctoral program. They spent their last day together filling out intake forms for legal aid groups — just in case.</p>

<p>Right up until their last minutes together at the train station, they wrestled with how cautious Öztürk should be when she returned to Massachusetts. Öztürk wondered if she should avoid communal dinners, a feature of Muslim social life during the holy month of Ramadan.</p>

<p>“I told her to keep going out, to be with her community. I wanted her to live her life,” E. recalled, her voice breaking.</p>

<p>“And then she got abducted in broad daylight.”</p>

<p>By now, much of the country has seen the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/26/us/video/tufts-student-detained-rumeysa-ozturk-ice-digvid">footage of Oztürk’s capture</a>.</p>

<p>Surveillance video from March 25 shows her walking to dinner in Somerville, Massachusetts, near the Tufts campus, chatting on the phone with her mother when she is swarmed by six masked plainclothes officers. Öztürk screams.</p>

<p>Within three minutes, she’s bundled into an unmarked car and whisked away, a jarring scene that showed the nation what President Donald Trump’s deportation campaign looks like on the street level: federal agents ambushing a Muslim woman who co-wrote an op-ed in a college newspaper.</p>

<p>The footage drew worldwide outrage and turned Öztürk into a powerful symbol of the Department of Homeland Security dragnet.</p>
        
    
                    

    
            Surveillance Video of Rümeysa Öztürk’s Capture
        

    
        
            
            
            

    
            (Obtained by ProPublica)
    
    
    

            <p><strong><a href="https://assets-d.propublica.org/v5/video/American-Rendition.mp4">Watch video ➜</a></strong></p>
        
    
    
        
    
                    
<p>To piece together what’s happened since then, ProPublica examined court filings and interviewed attorneys and Öztürk’s close friend, who regularly speaks to her in detention. What emerges is a more intimate picture of Öztürk and how a child development researcher charged with no crime ended up in a crowded cell in Louisiana. The interviews and court records also provide a glimpse into a sprawling, opaque apparatus designed to deport the maximum number of people with minimum accountability.</p>

<p>Her lawyers describe it as the story of a Trump-era rendition, a callback to the post-9/11 practice of federal agents grabbing Muslim suspects off the street and taking them to locations known for harsh conditions and shoddy oversight.</p>

<p>Öztürk is among nearly 1,000 students whose visas have been revoked, according to <a href="https://www.nafsa.org/ie-magazine/students-at-risk">a tally by the Association of International Educators</a>. And she is among several students and professors who have been detained.</p>

<p>Her detention was exceptional, immigration attorneys said, because it was caught on camera. What’s scariest, they say, is how fast the removals happen and how little is known about them.</p>

<p>Homeland Security spokespeople did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>The video of Öztürk’s arrest surfaced because Boston-area activists had set up a hotline for locals to report interactions with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The call that came in about Öztürk reported a “kidnapping,” said Fatema Ahmad of the Muslim Justice League, part of the advocacy network that obtained the footage.</p>

<p>“What broke me was her screaming. And knowing that the same thing had just happened to almost 400 people in the Boston area the week before,” she said, referring to a recent <a href="https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/ice-law-enforcement-partners-arrest-370-alien-offenders-during-enhanced-operation">six-day ICE operation</a>.</p>

<p>After her arrest, Öztürk was held by ICE incommunicado for nearly 24 hours, her attorneys said, during which time she suffered the first of four asthma attacks. </p>

<p>Only later, through court filings and conversations with Öztürk, her attorneys learned that in the course of a single night she was taken from Massachusetts to New Hampshire and then Vermont, where the next morning, she was loaded onto a plane and flown to an ICE outpost in Alexandria, Louisiana.</p>

<p>Her last stop was a detention center in Basile about an hour away, where she remains, one of two dozen women in a damp, mouse-infested cell built to hold 14, according to court filings.</p>

<p>ICE officials say in <a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/ozturk-v-trump?document=Declaration-of-ICE-ERO-Acting-Deputy-Field-Office-Director#press-releases">court documents</a> they couldn’t find a bed for Öztürk in New England, adding that out-of-state transfers are “routinely conducted after arrest, due to operational necessity.”</p>

<p>Immigration attorneys say the late-night hopscotch was an ICE tactic to complicate jurisdiction and thwart legal attempts to stop Öztürk’s removal. Louisiana and Texas, they say, are favored destinations because the courts there are viewed as friendlier to the Trump administration’s MAGA agenda, issuing decisions limiting migrant rights.</p>

<p>“It was like a relay race, and she was the baton,” Öztürk’s attorney Mahsa Khanbabai said.</p>

“Whole Other Level of Terror”
<p>On March 4, two weeks before their spring break reunion, Öztürk texted her friend E. to say she’d been “doxxed” by Canary Mission, part of an array of shadowy, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/01/us/israel-gaza-student-protests-canary-mission.html">right-wing Jewish groups</a> that are criticized for using cherry-picked statements and distorted context to portray even mild criticism of Israel as antisemitism or support for terrorism.</p>

<p>For more than a decade, hard-line pro-Israel groups have publicized the names of pro-Palestinian activists, academics and students, often with scant or dubious “evidence” to back allegations of anti-Jewish bigotry. The goal, civil liberties advocates say, is to silence protesters through campaigns that have cost targets jobs and <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2024/07/01/canary-mission-palestinian-protests/74222568007/">led to death threats</a>. On its website, Canary Mission said it is “motivated by a desire to combat” antisemitism on college campuses. It says it investigates individuals and groups “across the North American political spectrum, including the far-right, far-left and anti-Israel activists.”</p>

<p>The effort was stepped up during the wave of student protests that erupted in opposition to the war in Gaza.</p>

<p>Öztürk’s entry on the Canary Mission site, posted in February, claims she “engaged in anti-Israel activism in 2024,” citing the <a href="https://www.tuftsdaily.com/article/2024/03/4ftk27sm6jkj">op-ed she co-wrote</a> more than a year ago that accused Tufts of ignoring students’ calls to divest from companies with ties to Israel over human rights concerns.</p>

<p>“I can not believe how much time people have,” Öztürk texted her friend when she saw the post.</p>

<p>E. responded with an open-mouthed “shocked” emoji. The Canary Mission entry, she said, had unlocked “a whole other level of terror” for Öztürk.</p>

<p>“It was that feeling of having your privacy be so violated — for people to spend all this time and energy on one op-ed,” E. said.</p>

<p>The op-ed published in The Tufts Daily was signed by four authors, including Öztürk, and endorsed by more than 30 other unnamed students. The language echoed the <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/04/1161816">statements of United Nations officials</a> and international war crimes investigators about the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/how-many-palestinians-has-israels-gaza-offensive-killed-2025-01-15/">death toll in Gaza</a>, which according to health officials there has passed 50,000, with about a third of the casualties under 18.</p>

<p>Öztürk, an advocate for children in communities plagued by violence, was personally heartsick over images of burned and mangled Palestinian children. But she was not a prominent activist or a fixture at campus protests, her friends and attorneys say.</p>

<p>Öztürk’s attorneys, who are scheduled to appear Monday before a federal judge in Vermont, say the sole basis for revoking her visa appears to be the op-ed highlighted by Canary Mission.</p>

<p>Ramzi Kassem, a lawyer representing Öztürk, said pro-Israel groups are providing the administration with lists of targets for its deportation campaign against noncitizen student protesters. “The sequence of events,” he said, “is op-ed, doxxing, detention.”</p>

<p>Pro-Israel groups, <a href="https://x.com/canarymission/status/1905262753264046392">including Canary Mission</a>, have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/03/29/zionist-palestinians-deportations-x/">boasted about their influence</a> on the Trump administration’s targeting of student protesters. Immigration officials insist that they make their own removal decisions based on a number of factors, including a hard line on criticism of Israel.</p>

<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/28/us/politics/rubio-immigration-students-ozturk-chung-khalil.html">says he has revoked</a> more than 300 student visas, including for Khalil and Öztürk, under the Immigration and Nationality Act, which permits the deportation of noncitizens who are deemed “adversarial to the foreign policy and national security interests” of the United States.</p>

<p>“We gave you a visa to come and study and get a degree, not to become a social activist who tears up our university campuses,” Rubio told a news conference last month in response to a question about Öztürk’s detention. “Every day I find one of these lunatics, I take away their visa.”</p>

<p>A spokesperson said the State Department does not comment on ongoing litigation.</p>

<p>In a call with reporters on Thursday, attorney Marc Van Der Hout of Khalil’s legal team said the authority Rubio cites was intended for rare occasions involving high-level diplomatic matters, “not to be used to go after people for First Amendment-protected activity.”</p>

Overnight Odyssey
<p>Surrounded by masked officers on March 25, Öztürk had no idea who was seizing her or where she was being taken, according to <a href="https://www.aclum.org/sites/default/files/field_documents/2025-04-10_petr_motion_for_release_return_ex_9_ozturk_82-10.pdf">a statement filed on Thursday</a> in federal court. The operatives were dressed in civilian clothes, she wrote, so at first she worried they were vigilantes spurred by Canary Mission.</p>

<p>“I had never seen police approach and take someone away like this,” she wrote. “I thought they were people who had doxxed me and I was afraid for my safety.”</p>

<p>Öztürk’s statement details her harrowing night being shuttled across New England with little food after a day of fasting for Ramadan. She describes being shackled by her feet and stomach and then driven to different sites for meetings with unidentified men, some in uniform and some not. One group so unsettled her, Öztürk wrote, that she “was sure they were going to kill me.”</p>

<p>At another stop, described in the statement as an isolated parking lot, Öztürk repeatedly asked an officer if she was in physical danger.</p>

<p>“He seemed to feel guilty and said ‘we are not monsters,’” Öztürk wrote.</p>

<p>At the last stop in Vermont, Öztürk wrote, she arrived famished and with “a lot of motion sickness from all the driving.” Officers took her biometric data and a DNA sample.</p>

<p>She would stay there for the night, in a cell with just a hard bench and a toilet. Officers gained access to her cellphone, she wrote, including personal photos of her without her religious headscarf.</p>

<p>“During the night they came to my cell multiple times and asked me questions about wanting to apply for asylum and if I was a member of a terrorist organization,” Öztürk wrote. “I tried to be helpful and answer their questions but I was so tired and didn’t understand what was happening to me.”</p>

<p>Around 4 the next morning, she wrote, she was shackled again in preparation for a trip to the airport. She was told the destination was Louisiana. Her statement to the court recounts the parting words of one of her jailers: “I hope we treated you with respect.”</p>

<p>At nearly every stage of her detention, Öztürk, who takes daily preventative medication for asthma, experienced asthma attacks, which she says are triggered by fumes, mold or stress, court files say.</p>

<p>During one in Louisiana, Öztürk wrote, a nurse took her temperature and said, “You need to take that thing off your head,” before removing her hijab without asking. When Öztürk protested, the nurse told her, “This is for your health.”</p>

<p>By her fourth wheezing episode, Öztürk wrote, she didn’t bother to seek attention from her jailers in Louisiana: “I didn’t feel safe at the medical center.”</p>

<p>After the portrait Öztürk paints of ICE detention, her statement turns back to her old life, a reminder of how abruptly her world has shifted. From her cell in Louisiana, she described the plans she had in the coming months. Completing her dissertation. A conference in Minnesota. Students to mentor. A summer class to teach.</p>

<p>“I want to return to Tufts to resume all of my cherished work,” she concluded.</p>

Reunion Interrupted
<p>Öztürk and E. bonded in 2018 after meeting at a Muslim study group in New York, where they were both attending Columbia University.</p>

<p>They were in their 20s then, two bookish cat lovers who were serious about their studies and their faith. They went on nature walks and liked afternoon naps.</p>

<p>“Old ladies,” E. said with a laugh.</p>

<p>They remained close and took turns visiting after Öztürk left for Tufts and E. moved away from the city. Over the years, the pressures of grad school and distance had made their visits less frequent, E. said, so they’d been looking forward to their three-day spring break catch-up.</p>

<p>During the visit, E. said, the women broke their fast together and visited a mosque for late-night Ramadan prayers. They stopped by a children’s library Öztürk wanted to visit. They stayed up late talking, gaming out how to keep Öztürk safe from the Trump administration’s crackdown.</p>

<p>“She said, ‘I think this is going to be the last time I get to visit you,’” E. recalled. “I told her, ‘No, no, you’re going to be able to come again, don’t worry, and I’m going to come visit you.’ That all turned out to be wrong.”</p>

<p>The friends had kept in touch daily after parting at the train station. They exchanged mundane texts and voice notes about doing taxes and eating cookies. E. sent Öztürk a photo of the park where they had walked during their visit. “Rümeysa! The trees are starting to bloom again,” she wrote.</p>

<p>They last texted on March 25, a couple hours before Öztürk was detained on the way to dinner in Somerville.</p>

<p>E. didn’t find out what happened until the next morning, when she stumbled out of bed before dawn for the early meal Muslims eat before the daily Ramadan fast. Sipping her tea, E. scrolled through her phone and spotted a message that said, “Have you seen this?” alongside an alert about Öztürk’s arrest.</p>

<p>“It was like: ‘Is this real? Am I still asleep?’” she recalled.</p>

<p>E. said the idea of her gentle friend being swept into ICE custody still didn’t seem real until later that morning, when the video was released and she saw a familiar figure, in the same white jacket she’d worn on her visit.</p>

<p>“It was utterly nauseating to watch,” E. said. “So horrifying and so heartbreaking to see her have to be so violently taken that way.”</p>

Trying to Be a “Good Detainee”
<p>Two days after Öztürk’s transfer to Louisiana, E. received a call from a strange number that came up on her phone as “Prison/Jail.” It was Öztürk, in the first of what would become regular check-ins at random times of the day.</p>

<p>In interviews, E. showed ProPublica corroborating photos, text messages and voice notes of her interactions with her friend.</p>

<p>“She always starts with, ‘Is this a good time to talk?’ And I’m, like, ‘I’ve been waiting for this,’” E. said.</p>

<p>Some days, Öztürk sounds upbeat. Turkish diplomats, she told E., had delivered her a new hijab. Öztürk found a cookbook and noted a citrus salad recipe she might try someday. She cracked jokes about being too old to climb into a bunk bed every night.</p>

<p>In one call, Öztürk expressed relief that she’d filed her taxes before getting detained — a perfect example, E. said, of her overachieving friend’s wry sense of humor.</p>

<p>“She read the detainee handbook two times,” E. said. “She said, ‘I’m trying to be a good detainee.’”</p>

<p>Other calls are not as easy, E. said, adding that she didn’t want to divulge specifics out of respect for her friend’s privacy. In those harder talks, E. said, she wishes she could “be there to tell her it’ll be OK, give her a hug.”</p>

<p>Their conversations are sprinkled with reminders that Öztürk’s nightmare might not end soon. She asked for help canceling appointments and returning library books. She’s also in the process of requesting a single paperback, per detention regulations.</p>

<p>If approved, she wants E. to find her a guide for writing children’s literature, preferably with exercises she could do from her cell. E. said her heart ached when Öztürk asked her to make the book a long one.</p>

<p>The calls and tasks ease feelings of helplessness, E. said, an antidote for the guilt that sneaks up on her when she walks outside on a sunny day.</p>

<p>“How is it that we’re moving forward,” she said, “while my closest friend is rotting in this place?”</p>

<p>On a late afternoon in November 2017, Witney Arch told her 1-1/2-year-old son to stop playing and come inside. Upset, he grabbed her right breast when she picked him up. She experienced a shock of pain but did not think it was anything serious. A week later, however, the ache had not subsided. After trips to several doctors, a biopsy revealed that Arch had early-stage breast cancer. Her surgeon told her that it was likely invasive and aggressive.</p>

<p>By the end of January, she had made two critical decisions. She would get a double mastectomy. And she wanted her operation at the Center for Restorative Breast Surgery in New Orleans, a medical facility renowned for its highly specialized approach to breast cancer care and reconstruction. The two surgeons who founded it had pioneered techniques that used a woman’s own body tissue to form new breasts post mastectomy. The idea of a natural restoration appealed to Arch. “I don’t judge anybody for getting implants, especially if you’ve had cancer,” she said. “But I felt like I was taking something foreign out of my body, cancer, and I did not want to put something foreign back in.”</p>

<p>Arch was a 42-year-old preschool teacher for her church, with four young children, living in a suburb of New Orleans. The 1-1/2-year-old had been born with Sturge-Weber syndrome, a rare neurological disorder. Caring for him consumed her life. By nature upbeat and optimistic, Arch felt blessed that her son’s act of defiance had led to an early diagnosis. “We’re going to pray about this and we’re going to figure it out,” she told her husband.</p>

<p>Arch asked her insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana, for approval to go to the center for her care, and the company granted it, a process known as prior authorization. Then, a week or so before her surgery, Arch was wrangling child care and meal plans when she got a call from the insurer. The representative on the line was trying to persuade her to have the surgery elsewhere. She urged Arch to seek a hospital that, unlike the center, was in network and charged less. “Do you realize how much this is going to cost?” Arch remembered the agent asking. Arch did not need more stress, but here it was — from her own health plan. “I feel very comfortable with my decision,” she replied. “My doctor teaches other doctors around the world how to do this.” Over the next year, Arch underwent five operations to rid herself of cancer and reconstruct her breasts.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            Witney Arch received authorization from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Louisiana for her mastectomy and breast restoration, but the insurer did not pay the full bill from the Center for Restorative Breast Surgery.

<p>Arch did not know it at the time, but her surgery would become evidence in a long-running legal fight between the breast center’s founders, surgeons Frank DellaCroce and Scott Sullivan, and Blue Cross, Louisiana’s biggest health insurance company, with an estimated two-thirds share of the market. DellaCroce and Sullivan had repeatedly sued the insurer, alleging that it granted approvals for surgery but then denied payments or paid only a fraction of patients’ bills. They pointed to calls like the one Arch received as proof of the company’s effort to drive away patients. The aggressive legal attack, they knew, was fraught. Litigation against the $3.4 billion company would take a long time and a lot of money. The chances of winning were slight. “You fight dragons at great peril,” DellaCroce would tell friends. But this September, after 18 years and several defeats in court, jurors found Blue Cross liable for fraud. They awarded the center $421 million — one of the largest verdicts ever to a single medical practice outside of a class-action lawsuit. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25893394-statement-from-blue-cross-and-blue-shield-of-louisiana/">In a statement</a>, Blue Cross said it “disagrees with the jury’s decision, which we believe was wrong on the facts and the law. We have filed an appeal and expect to be successful.”</p>

<p>Frustration with insurers is at an all-time high. The December fatal shooting of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson allegedly by Luigi Mangione serves as an extreme and tragic example. Doctors and insurers are locked into a perpetual conflict over health care costs, with patients caught in the middle. Doctors accuse insurance plans of blocking payments for health care treatments that can save the patients’ lives. Insurance companies insist they shouldn’t pay for procedures that they say are unnecessary or overpriced. It is easy to emerge from an examination of the American health care system with a cynicism that both sides are broken and corrupt.</p>

<p>However, interviews with scores of doctors, patients and insurance executives, as well as reviews of internal documents, regulatory filings and academic studies, reveal a fundamental truth: The two sides are not evenly matched. Insurance companies are players in the fight over money, and they are also the referees. Insurers produce their own guidelines to determine whether to pay claims. When a doctor appeals a denial, insurers make all the initial decisions. In legal settings, insurers are often given favorable standing in their ability to set what conditions they are required to cover. Federal and state insurance regulators lack the resources to pursue individual complaints against multibillion-dollar companies. Six major insurers, which include some of the nation’s largest companies, cover half of all Americans. They are pitted against tens of thousands of doctors’ practices and large hospital chains.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>The Blue Cross trial provides a rare opportunity to expose in detail the ways that health insurance companies wield power over doctors and their patients. Blue Cross executives testified that the breast center charged too much money — sometimes more than $180,000 for an operation. The center, they said, deserved special attention because it had a history of questionable charges. But the insurer’s defense went even further, to the very meaning of “prior authorization,” which it had granted women like Arch to pursue surgery. The authorization, they said in court, recognized that a procedure was medically necessary, but it also contained a clause that it was “<em>not</em> a guarantee of payment.” Blue Cross was not obliged to pay the center anything, top executives testified. “Let me be clear: The authorization never says we’re going to pay you,” said Steven Udvarhelyi, who was the CEO for the insurer from 2016 to 2024, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25882446-steven-udvarhelyi-deposition/#document/p1/a2630959">in a deposition</a>. “That’s why there’s a disclaimer.</p>

<p>From 2015 through 2023, the Baton Rouge-based insurer paid, on average, less than 9% of the charges billed by the breast center for more than 7,800 individual medical procedures — even though it had authorized all of them. Thousands of such claims were never paid at all, according to court records. Testimony revealed that the health plan never considered thousands of appeals filed by the center. Corporate documents showed Blue Cross executives had set up secret processes for approving operations and reimbursing the clinic and its doctors that resulted in reduced fees and payment delays. One lucrative strategy: A national-level policy allowed Blue Cross Louisiana to take a cut of any savings it achieved in paying the breast center on behalf of patients covered by out-of-state Blue Cross companies, meaning the less the insurer paid out, the more it earned.</p>

<p>In Sullivan’s words, the insurer was hypocritical, “morally bankrupt.” Blue Cross had stranded many of the center’s patients with high bills, amounts that it had absorbed over the years. On several occasions, though, Blue Cross executives had signed special one-time deals with the center, known as single case agreements, to pay for their wives’ cancer treatment. To Sullivan, it seemed the insurer was willing to pay the center when patients had connections but would fight when patients did not.</p>

<p>Blue Cross declined to comment on any individual cases but said in a statement that single case agreements were “common in the industry” and were available to all members when needed to access out-of-network providers.</p>

<p>Nobody would take <a href="https://www.breastcenter.com/">the breast center and its adjoining hospital</a> as an ordinary medical establishment. The two facilities take up a city block along St. Charles Avenue, the thoroughfare famous for its streetcars, Mardi Gras parades and Queen Anne mansions. Patients access the complex — created by merging a former law office, funeral home, car dealership and Dunkin’ Donuts — by driving around back where a porte cochere leads into a soaring atrium. Light pours in through windows set in the high ceiling. Arrangements of white orchids are scattered among comfortable couches and chairs. Here, women consult with doctors to plan their treatment. Surgeries are performed at the 39-bed hospital, which has an Icee machine in a family room. New-age music plays softly throughout the building. Rooms are designed to be as homey as possible, with medical gear hidden away and seascapes by a local artist hanging on the wall. One patient’s husband referred to it as a “spa-spital.”</p>

<p>The idea of combining the luxury feel of an upscale plastic surgery practice with the mission-driven zeal of a medical clinic came to DellaCroce and Sullivan while they were young surgeons. The two grew up in Louisiana. Sullivan spent much of his childhood in Mandeville, a suburb of New Orleans on the north side of Lake Ponchartrain, his dad employed in the oil and gas industry. His mother wanted him to be a priest or a doctor. “I definitely was not going to become a priest,” he said. DellaCroce’s father worked at the paper mill in West Monroe in the state’s northern neck. His mother, a nurse, gave him an appreciation for medicine as a career that was “meaningful and challenging.”</p>

<p>They became friends while working at the Louisiana State University medical center, where they earned the nickname “the Sushi Brothers” for their favorite lunch. They were drawn to microsurgery and breast reconstruction because it was an emerging field that was innovating and improving care. Both men became board-certified in plastic surgery. Sullivan, 60, is the hard-charging businessman, stocky, direct and blunt. DellaCroce, 58, with a ponytail, goatee and soft drawl, is more the diplomat, patient and cerebral. The pair have lectured around the world and written numerous medical journal articles.</p>

<p>They opened their first office in 2003 in a single room rented from a fellow doctor at what was then known as Memorial Medical Center, the hulking private hospital in New Orleans. They performed operations at facilities throughout the region but found that most gave little consideration to their patients’ comfort. They wanted to build a different kind of hospital. “Can we give them that little bit of extra without breaking the budget to make the experience less awful? Can’t make it great, but can you make it less awful?” DellaCroce explained. “Can you attend to the human side of this patient and give them the added value of peace and confidence?” Hurricane Katrina set back their construction plans, and the new edifice, named the St. Charles Surgical Hospital, did not open its doors until 2009. It boasts of being the only hospital in the country devoted solely to care for breast cancer patients who have received mastectomies. The center does not provide radiation or chemotherapy treatments. The majority of patients come from out of state.</p>

<p>Women seeking to have their breasts restored after a mastectomy face two paths. Some choose a relatively straightforward surgical procedure using implants filled with silicone or another gel. The center specializes in the other option, what’s known as autologous tissue reconstruction, where a woman’s own fat is taken from one part of the body, like the bottom or the stomach, and used to rebuild the breast. The procedure requires a longer recovery time, but the new breasts become part of the body.</p>

<p>The transplant surgery is lengthy and complex. Operations can last up to 12 hours with big medical teams involved. One surgeon performs the mastectomy while another creates a new breast by knitting together layers of fat and tissue. Concentration is intense. The surgeons stare through glasses with microscopes to connect new blood vessels with a needle that’s thinner than an eyelash, using thread less than half the width of a human hair. DellaCroce and Sullivan invented techniques, for example, allowing tissue to be taken from multiple sites when a woman did not have enough fat in one part of her body for a full restoration.</p>

<p>One afternoon last fall, DellaCroce strode into a cavernous operating room to check on a patient. On the table in front of him, a woman lay covered in curtains of blue surgical cloth, only her torso exposed. Earlier in the day, a surgical oncologist had removed her right breast as part of a mastectomy to treat her cancer. Later, another surgeon had taken flaps of fat from her stomach and interlaced them with blood vessels to create a new breast to replace the lost one. Now, in the fifth hour of surgery, a physician’s assistant leaned over her midsection, closing an incision along her side with some final stitches. Nurses hurried around the space, preparing to wrap up the operation. Paul Simon’s “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq-gYOrU8bA">You Can Call Me Al</a>” played in the background. The smell of burnt flesh hung in the air. A blue light signaled that the new arteries were successfully pumping blood. “Wow, that woman looks really good,” DellaCroce told the physician’s assistant. “Nice job.”</p>

<p>There is no denying that the center’s high-end treatment means high costs. The median charge for an operation and hospital stay is about $165,000. DellaCroce and Sullivan hired consultants to review other well-regarded practices, who advised them their prices were competitive with their peers. “We weren’t asking to be paid LeBron James, best of the best, even though we feel we’re in the top 1 or 2% of the country,” Sullivan said. “We just wanted something fair.”</p>

<p>It is one of the quirks of the American health care system that insurers almost never pay the prices for procedures demanded by doctors and hospitals.</p>

<p>To understand why requires a tour of the grand bargain at the heart of the health insurance system. Insurance companies negotiate with hospitals and doctors to discount reimbursements on medical procedures, like office visits or MRI scans. Providers who sign these contracts are in network. Insurance companies like in-network doctors because they can budget for health expenses and set premiums accordingly. Doctors and hospitals agree to be in network because they get a steady stream of insured patients.</p>

<p>DellaCroce and Sullivan held contracts with insurers that resulted in average payments to the center’s doctors in the $20,000 to $30,000 range. But DellaCroce and Sullivan never came to an agreement with Blue Cross. That made them an exception in Louisiana — the insurer is so dominant that 97% of local physicians and hospitals are in network. DellaCroce and Sullivan said the company was not offering them enough money — in some cases not even enough to cover the cost of the surgeries, they argued in court documents. The doctors and their hospital remained out of network, meaning they charged Blue Cross the full price for their procedures.</p>

<p>Such charges are controversial. Insurance companies and many health experts say they are too often inflated and untethered from actual costs. Physicians and hospitals say their fees are justified, reflecting the true price of medical care. In the end, insurers — especially in states like Louisiana, with few competitors — use their market power in negotiations to set reimbursements at what they want to pay, not what doctors charge.</p>

<p>At Blue Cross, Dwight Brower was charged with reviewing the bills from the breast center. He had worked as a physician at a small family practice in Baton Rouge and then at a local hospital before joining Blue Cross as a medical director. He helped oversee prior authorizations. While many patients assume that an approval means an insurer will pay for an operation, it is simply a recognition that a procedure is medically necessary. Federal law mandates that private insurers cover breast restorations for women who undergo mastectomies because of cancer or genetic risk. And patients, in general, are allowed to choose their own doctors.</p>

<p>However, since the center was out of network and had no contract with the insurer, Blue Cross determined how much it would pay for the treatment, and Brower believed that the breast center’s bills were exorbitant. “I did not think that they were reasonable,” <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537636-2024-09-13-st-charles-20240913-am/?mode=document#document/p47/a2630973">he would later testify</a>. Surgeons doing lung transplants or brain surgery rarely billed Blue Cross more than $50,000 for their work. Why should DellaCroce and Sullivan get so much more? “Don’t get me wrong. The surgeons at the center are extremely skilled,” he acknowledged. The operations were often lengthy. “But so are open-heart surgeries,” he said. “Relative to some of the other extremely complicated surgeries done by other surgeons in other areas of the body, it just seemed like their fee schedule was extremely high.”</p>

<p>Blue Cross Louisiana executives testified that they did not even consider doctors’ invoices when making decisions on what to reimburse because such charges were “unregulated” and “nonstandard.” Instead, they paid “<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25555648-2017-12-04-blue-cross-blue-shield-payment-for-out-of-network-providers/">an amount we establish</a>” — unless the doctor’s bill was cheaper. In the end, the insurer said it settled on reimbursing the breast center about the same as in-network doctors performing similar operations, even though DellaCroce and Sullivan did not benefit from having patients referred to them. In practice, that meant the insurer paid out a fraction of the breast center’s bills. Of the 7,837 medical procedures in dispute in the lawsuit, involving 1,680 patients, Blue Cross paid about $43 million on invoices totaling $500 million. Some 60% of the claims weren’t reimbursed at all. The difference between the bill and the payment could be striking. For example, in the case of Arch, Blue Cross paid $8,580 out of $102,722 for one operation. For another, it paid $3,190 out of $34,975.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        <p>Fundamentally, I think their problem was that we were doctors who had control. That was regarded as a threat.</p>

<p>Executives said the Blue Cross reimbursements were fair, designed to keep premiums low for the nearly 2 million Louisianans who depended on the insurer to cover their health care. Paying the breast center’s full fees would add to its customers’ burden, they said. “If we were to just agree to any rates or any prices set by physicians or any providers, it would cause cost to be exorbitantly high for both the plan and for members particularly, because we wouldn’t be able to forecast or make sure those plans are actually sound,” <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537645-208c471/#document/p5/a2630982">said</a> Curtis Anders, the vice president of provider networks for Blue Cross. “Premiums would increase.”</p>

<p>For many out-of-network doctors, payments lower than their invoices are an infuriating part of doing business. They absorb the costs, or pass them on to their patients, a practice known as balance billing that can result in medical debt. DellaCroce and Sullivan were the rare physicians with the tenacity to fight. The center collected money from both insurers and patients — but it carried the unpaid portion of invoices on its books. That amount grew every year as it battled Blue Cross.</p>

<p>DellaCroce and Sullivan were convinced that Blue Cross had singled them out for their obstreperousness, but they had no proof. Then, during a phone call one day, an employee for the center was talking to a Blue Cross representative to obtain a prior authorization. The representative let slip that the request required special handling. The breast center’s doctors were flagged on an internal roster. It was called the targeted list.</p>

        Discoveries
    
        
    
                    
<p>On Dec. 8, 2023, several dozen attorneys and paralegals from Chehardy Sherman Williams, one of New Orleans’ top law firms, were celebrating their annual holiday party. They had gathered in a private dining room with gilded mirrors and shimmering chandeliers at Arnaud’s restaurant, a bastion of Creole cuisine in the heart of the French Quarter. The waiters served shrimp remoulade, prime rib and turtle soup. Small talk filled the air.</p>

<p>Suddenly, several attorneys’ cellphones buzzed as they all received the same email, a message from the lawyers for Blue Cross. It contained discovery for the case, more than 42,000 pages of internal documents, emails and policies. Matthew Sherman, one of the attorneys representing the center, turned to a colleague. “Can you believe this?” he asked. It was like something from a John Grisham novel, the kind of thing he and his friends had joked about at law school, a document dump at Christmas time. By long tradition, many of New Orleans’ biggest law firms hold their holiday parties on the same Friday afternoon in December. Afterward, rival attorneys from around town gather for drinks under a flag of truce at a local bar. Sherman realized there would be no afterparty this year. Nor much of a holiday vacation.</p>

<p>The delivery of the documents was a Christmas gift nearly 20 years in the making. DellaCroce and Sullivan’s <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25883705-2006-6487-crbs-v-bcbs-early-lawsuit/">first lawsuits</a> against Blue Cross, involving 88 breach-of-contract claims filed in a Louisiana civil court beginning in 2006, were dismissed because of a federal court ruling regarding jurisdiction. A <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25883734-2010-04-06-2010-03356-crbs-v-bcbsla-complaint/">second lawsuit</a>, which lasted from 2010 through 2017, resulted in limited discovery and a two-day trial in federal court. Jurors found that Blue Cross had failed to tell the center how much it would pay for procedures, but they also ruled the center had not been financially harmed. A judge dismissed the remaining claims.</p>

<p>DellaCroce and Sullivan launched their <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537857-2019-10-10-3rd-amended-complaint/">third lawsuit</a> in February 2017 with a novel legal theory: They accused Blue Cross of fraud. They contended that for years the insurer had issued prior authorizations without the intention of paying the actual bills. Their lawyers had sought the targeted list during discovery to help prove the case. Blue Cross denied it existed.</p>

<p>But now, as Sherman and fellow attorney Patrick Follette began poring over the thousands of documents, they came upon a spreadsheet that said “<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537631-2024-09-06-am-st-charles-surgical-20240906-am/?mode=document#document/p56/a2624531">Targeted Provider List</a>.” The first names on the list were DellaCroce and Sullivan. It was labeled “confidential” and dated June 2007 — about a year after the pair had filed their first lawsuit against Blue Cross alleging nonpayment. More digging turned up other documents. There was a “blocked” list that also featured the two doctors.</p>

<p>A corporate policy document provided what DellaCroce and Sullivan considered the most revealing explanation for Blue Cross’ financial motivation. Blue Cross insurers are independent companies that operate under a common set of rules, similar to franchisees in a fast-food chain. When a person covered by Blue Cross in their home state receives treatment in another state, the Blue Cross where the treatment occurs pays the provider and then recoups the cost from the home-state plan. What the attorneys discovered was that Blue Cross Louisiana would receive a share of any savings it could generate for the home-state plan. Say, for instance, Blue Cross Alabama was facing a bill of $5,000 for a procedure. If Blue Cross Louisiana instead paid $1,000, it saved the Alabama plan $4,000. The policy allowed Blue Cross Louisiana <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537637-20736f1/?mode=document#document/p36/a2631133">to earn 16% of the savings</a> — in this scenario, $640.</p>

<p>For DellaCroce and Sullivan, the revelations cemented their belief that Blue Cross was a bad corporate actor more interested in power and control than health care. The percentage fee incentivized the insurer to pay the doctors as little as possible. The bigger the savings, the more Blue Cross made. “It’s win-win,” DellaCroce said. “That’s their pay day.”</p>

<p>As the trial approached, Blue Cross attempted to settle the case. DellaCroce and Sullivan refused the offer as too low.</p>

        The Trial
    
        
    
                    
<p>On the afternoon of Sept. 5, 2024, the case — St. Charles Surgical Hospital, L.L.C. and Center for Restorative Breast Surgery, L.L.C. v. Louisiana Health Service &amp; Indemnity Company D/B/A Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Louisiana, Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Louisiana, Inc. and HMO Louisiana, Inc. — opened in Division C of the Orleans Parish Civil District Court, a high-ceilinged room with dark brown benches and tables, fake marble columns and fluorescent lights. James Williams, the chief litigator for the hospital, had already impressed the 45 potential jurors by memorizing all their names and backgrounds during jury selection. Now, he stood up and placed a football on the plaintiff’s table in front of the 12 chosen to try the case, which included a third grade teacher, a movie stunt double and a hotel manager. He warned them that they would hear a lot of “insurance talk” from Blue Cross. “I’m going to ask you, ladies and gentlemen on the jury, keep your eye on the ball. Keep your eye on what this case is about,” Williams told them. “If they start saying things like, ‘Well, oh, we paid them what we thought was fair, 9%,’ keep your eye on the ball, right?”</p>

<p>Over 10 days — interrupted by a two-day break to allow a hurricane to pass across Louisiana — Williams made his case that Blue Cross had defrauded his clients by making promises to pay but failing to deliver.</p>

<p>Much of Blue Cross’ defense had relied on the notice that a prior authorization was no guarantee of payment. The insurer had not committed fraud, it said, since it never explicitly promised the center to reimburse anything. Udvarhelyi, the former CEO, had insisted on that. But on the stand, Blue Cross witnesses provided a more nuanced explanation. They acknowledged that the disclaimer was not meant as a general excuse to free the company from paying bills. A prior authorization “usually” resulted in a payment, testified Brower, who reviewed the center’s bills. He said that the notice was intended for specific situations. For instance, Blue Cross would not cover a woman who dropped out of her insurance before the operation. Nor would it pay anything if a patient had not met her deductible. But otherwise, Brower said, Blue Cross intended to compensate for a procedure that it had authorized. “It’s inappropriate for us as a company to approve a code and then turn around and deny it,” <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537637-20736f1/?mode=document#document/p13/a2624462">Brower said</a>.</p>
        
    
                    

    
        

                        
                    
                

            During the trial, Williams told jurors to “keep your eye on the ball.”

<p>Over the years, the center had appealed thousands of reimbursements for being too low. It hired additional employees to manage the paperwork. At the trial, Blue Cross revealed that it had never considered any of the appeals — nor had it ever told the center that they were pointless. “An appeal is not available to review an underpayment,” <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537645-208c471/#document/p37/a2630979">acknowledged</a> Paula Shepherd, a Blue Cross executive vice president. The insurer simply issued an edict — the payment was correct.</p>

<p>This was the core of the case. The insurer set the rules. The insurer set the prices. Doctors could appeal to a state insurance regulator. But if that failed, and it often did, the only recourse was a long, costly lawsuit.</p>

<p>Williams <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537630-2024-02/?mode=document#document/p27/a2631151">summed up</a> for the jury the center’s treatment at the hands of Blue Cross: “Our payments are slow pay, low pay or no pay.”</p>

<p>In countering those arguments, Blue Cross witnesses explained that the insurer was committed to paying for Louisianans’ health care and keeping costs low. As a nonprofit, it directed any excess revenue from operations back into the business. (Udvarhelyi, the CEO, did acknowledge that his salary, over $1 million, included bonuses that depended on hitting revenue targets and increasing membership.)</p>

<p>Brian West, a Blue Cross executive who monitored payments, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537635-2024-09-10-st-charles-20240910/?mode=document#document/p14/a2631153">said the center</a> had engaged in “egregious” billing practices. “They are bad actors in the billing world,” he said. But company witnesses offered only a handful of examples. Sometimes the center mistakenly coded its bills in a way that appeared to charge for four separate breast reconstructions in a single operation. In other cases, the center asked for payment for two surgeons in the room at the same time. But Blue Cross, following Medicare guidelines, would pay two surgeons only 20% more than the reimbursement for a single surgeon.</p>

<p>Blue Cross did not accuse the center of any intentional miscoding — but the sloppy billing led to additional scrutiny, the company’s witnesses said. The targeted list, a witness testified, had been created especially for the center, requiring all prior authorization requests to bypass normal routes for a special review by company doctors. The blocked list meant that each bill from the center received a manual scrub by payment specialists before reimbursement. <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537635-2024-09-10-st-charles-20240910/#document/p17/a2631155">Blue Cross acknowledged</a> the careful checking often resulted in the need for more information from the center, which could result in slower processing of claims. But the lists, executives insisted, were not designed to reduce payments. “Basically, no harm was done,” <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25537634-2058691/#document/p55/a2631154">said</a> Becky Juncker, who was involved in approving surgical procedures.</p>

<p>Company witnesses explained that the 16% received in saving money for out-of-state Blue Cross insurers was a fee to cover the costs of handling adjustments of the claim — though they were not able to explain why Blue Cross did not charge a flat fee for its services.</p>

<p>Blue Cross also defended itself against the accusation that it had paid nothing for 60% of the charges for individual procedures. Witnesses said the insurer had followed industry practice in bundling charges to make a single payment for an operation. An attorney for the center noted that it had never agreed to take bundled payments — Blue Cross had imposed them.</p>

<p>As to the calls to women like Arch? That was an effort to save members money. “Our medical area would reach out to our members who were utilizing out-of-network providers to help them understand the, I would say, the financial implications,” said Shepherd, the Blue Cross executive vice president, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25892223-2023-12-11-paula-shepherd-depo/?mode=document#document/p1/a2631176">in a deposition</a>. “It could be financially catastrophic to a member to have an out-of-network claim that they are financially responsible for. It’s a huge difference.”</p>

<p>In summing up the case, Kim Boyle, the lead attorney for the company, told jurors that Blue Cross had not committed fraud. It had acted to ensure the company and its members paid a fair price for the center’s services, she said. “There’s no scheme. There’s no plot. There’s no mafia. There are no Blue Cross employees of Louisiana that are sitting in some smoke-filled room in Baton Rouge, plotting against these plaintiffs on St. Charles Avenue in New Orleans,” Boyle said. “It’s fiction; it’s fancy; it’s completely made up.”</p>

<p>On Sept. 20, at 1:57 p.m., Judge Sidney H. Cates IV sent the jurors to deliberate. The center attorneys retreated to a nearby hotel to await the verdict. About two hours later, they were summoned back to Division C. Williams put his head down and swore. He worried that such a quick return in the legally complex case meant victory for Blue Cross.</p>

<p>The center’s lawyers paid close attention to Cates as he reviewed the jurors’ decision. It was a two-page form. If the jurors found in favor of Blue Cross, the judge would have no reason to read on. Cates flipped to the second page: The jurors had found Blue Cross liable for fraud. “Please express in dollars the total monetary compensation, if any, Blue Cross owes the hospital and the center for the damages,” Cates said, <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/25892343-2024-09-27-jury-form-with-verdict/?mode=document">reading from the verdict</a>. “Net damages, $421,488,633.” The center’s lawyers stood and shook hands as the insurer’s attorneys prepared to leave the courtroom.</p>

<p>DellaCroce was in surgery at the hospital, having expected a longer deliberation. Sullivan was in the courtroom to hear the verdict. Afterward, jurors approached and thanked him for his work. He teared up. “We would have given more if we had been asked for more. That’s how egregious the fraud was,” Juliet Laughlin, a 58-year-old property manager who served as forewoman, later said. “There had been wrong done.”</p>
        
    
                            
    
                    
<p>Blue Cross has appealed the verdict. A health insurance trade group has warned that the finding sets a dangerous precedent. If allowed to stand, insurance companies in Louisiana may find themselves forced to pay whatever price is demanded by out-of-network doctors — which in turn could raise health insurance premiums across the state, the Louisiana Association of Health Plans said in a statement.</p>

<p>For DellaCroce and Sullivan, the verdict was vindication. They had refused to sign contracts they thought unfair. They had rejected settlement offers they thought too low. The trial had revealed Blue Cross’ domineering behavior. “Fundamentally, I think their problem was that we were doctors who had control,” DellaCroce said. “That was regarded as a threat.”</p>

<p>In the months since the judgment, Blue Cross has not changed its practices, the doctors said. It has not approached with an offer that would bring the hospital in network. It still issues prior authorizations for women’s surgeries. And it still pays only a fraction of the billed fees.</p>

                        <p><strong>Update, April 16, 2025:</strong> Janitorial services at Montlake Laboratory were restored on Monday.</p>

        

    
      
  



                    
<p>Federal scientists responsible for monitoring the health of West Coast fisheries are cleaning office bathrooms and reconsidering critical experiments after the Department of Commerce failed to renew their lab’s contracts for hazardous waste disposal, janitorial services, IT and building maintenance.</p>

<p>Trash is piling up at the Northwest Fisheries Science Center, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, staffers told ProPublica. Ecologists, chemists and biologists at Montlake Laboratory, the center’s headquarters in Seattle, are taking turns hauling garbage to the dumpster and discussing whether they should create a sign-up sheet to scrub toilets.</p>

<p>The scientists — who conduct genetic sampling of endangered salmon to check the species’ stock status and survival — routinely work with chemicals that can burn skin, erupt into flames and cause cancer. At least one said they’d have to delay mission-critical research if hazardous waste removal isn’t restored.</p>

<p>The deteriorating conditions at Montlake stem from a new policy at the Commerce Department that says Secretary Howard Lutnick must personally approve all contracts over $100,000. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/09/nx-s1-5356166/noaa-contracts-reviewed-one-by-one">NPR reported that the bottleneck</a> has disrupted operations at many NOAA facilities.</p>
        
    
                    
<p>ProPublica spoke to three Montlake employees who described what it was like to work there as, one by one, service contracts expire and aren’t renewed. People are running around looking for compost bags and wondering who will empty out the female sanitary waste containers in the bathrooms, they said. The floors are getting dirty and workers have no access to vacuums or mops. Some scientists have bought their own soap and cleaning supplies.</p>

<p>Nor can people escape by working from home: the Trump administration has increasingly ordered federal workers to return to the office five days a week. At Montlake, that policy will apply to everyone by April 21.</p>

<p>“It’s making our work unsafe, and it’s unsanitary for any workplace,” but especially an active laboratory full of fire-reactive chemicals and bacteria, one Montlake researcher said.</p>

<p>Press officers at NOAA, the Commerce Department and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

<p>Montlake employees were informed last week that a contract for safety services — which includes the staff who move laboratory waste off-campus to designated disposal sites — would lapse after April 9, leaving just one person responsible for this task. Hazardous waste “pickups from labs may be delayed,” employees were warned in a recent email.</p>

<p>The building maintenance team’s contract expired Wednesday, which decimated the staff that had handled plumbing, HVAC and the elevators. Other contacts lapsed in late March, leaving the Seattle lab with zero janitorial staff and a skeleton crew of IT specialists.</p>

<p>During a big staff meeting at Montlake on Wednesday, lab leaders said they had no updates on when the contracts might be renewed, one researcher said. They also acknowledged it was unfair that everyone would need to pitch in on janitorial duties on top of their actual jobs.</p>

<p>Nick Tolimieri, a union representative for Montlake employees, said the problem is “all part of the large-scale bullying program” to push out federal workers. It seems like every Friday “we get some kind of message that makes you unable to sleep for the entire weekend,” he said. Now, with these lapsed contracts, it’s getting “more and more petty.”</p>

<p>The problems, large and small, at Montlake provide a case study of the chaos that’s engulfed federal workers across many agencies as the Trump administration has fired staff, dumped contracts and eliminated long-time operational support. Yesterday, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/10/noaa-firings-trump">hundreds of NOAA workers who had been fired in February</a>, then briefly reinstated, were fired again. </p>

<p>Local management had new service contracts ready to go ages ago, Tolimieri said. The delay from headquarters means employees will struggle to get repairs for their computers or basic building maintenance; the aging elevators at Montlake already break so often that Tolimieri joked it would be easier to send notices on the occasions when they did work.</p>

<p>The fisheries center employs more than 350 people, most of whom work at Montlake. The rest are scattered across several research stations in Oregon and Washington.</p>

<p>Staff at the center conduct research and provide scientific advice for policies on sustainable fishing and endangered species, including a population of orcas in Puget Sound. They test seafood after oil spills to ensure the fish are safe to eat. Their work helps restore native salmon populations and support regional farming.</p>

<p>NOAA is “so uncontroversial,” said the Montlake researcher who’s worried about hazardous waste disposal. Employees are just “trying to do weather reports and give people good seafood.”</p>

<p>The researcher said lab workers are trained in basic lab safety, so the chemicals are properly stored, handled and placed into appropriate waste containers after use. But there’s a limit to how much chemical waste can be kept on site. And the contractors who left were experts on handling emergencies like large chemical spills or serious toxic exposures.</p>

<p>If those contractors don’t return soon, the researcher said, the lab may need to delay or pause important research.</p>

<p>That could include chemical-intensive lab work like testing sea lions, killer whales and walruses from Alaska for environmental contaminants, Tolimieri said.</p>

<p>“For a bunch of people who are screaming about efficiency,” he said, referring to the administration’s efforts to downsize the federal government, “they’ve done the most inefficient things possible.”</p>
